Verse_Ch: 1:13 你眼目清洁不看邪僻，不看奸恶；行诡诈的，你为何看着不理呢？恶人吞灭比自己公义的，你为何静默不语呢？ ###EN### You who are of purer eyes than to behold evil And who cannot look upon wrong, Why do You look upon them who deal treacherously And keep silent when the wicked man swallows up him who is more righteous than he?
Verse_Ch: 1:14 你使人如海中的鱼，如无人管辖的爬物。 ###EN### And You make man like the fish of the sea, Like the creeping things, who have no one to rule for them.
Verse_Ch: 1:15 他们用钩将众人钩上，用网拖走，用拉网聚集；因此，他们喜乐欢腾， ###EN### They take all of them up with a hook; They drag them off in their net And gather them into their seine; So they rejoice and exult.
Verse_Ch: 1:16 就向自己的网献祭，向自己的拉网烧香，因他们由此得肥美的分，和充裕的食物。 ###EN### Therefore they offer sacrifices to their net And burn incense to their seine, For by them their portion is fat And their food is plenteous.
