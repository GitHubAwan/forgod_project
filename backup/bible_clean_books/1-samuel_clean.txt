Verse_Ch: 1:5 但他给哈拿的分却是双倍的，因为他爱哈拿。无奈耶和华使哈拿不能生育。 ###EN### But he would give a double portion to Hannah, for it was Hannah whom he loved; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.

Verse_Ch: 1:13 原来哈拿心中诉说，只动嘴唇，听不见声音，因此以利以为她喝醉了。 ###EN### And Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought that she was drunk.

Verse_Ch: 1:15 哈拿回答说，我主阿，不是这样。我是灵里受压的妇人，淡酒浓酒都没有喝，但在耶和华面前倾心吐意。 ###EN### And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord. I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before Jehovah.
Verse_Ch: 1:16 不要将婢女看作卑劣的女子。我因被人激动，愁苦太重，所以一直诉说到如今。 ###EN### Do not take your female servant for a worthless woman; for out of the greatness of my anxiety and provocation I have been speaking all this time.
Verse_Ch: 1:17 以利回答说，你平平安安的去罢，愿以色列的神将你向祂所求的赐给你。 ###EN### Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have requested from Him.

Verse_Ch: 2:13 也不理会祭司从百姓所当得的分。凡有人献祭，正煮肉的时候，祭司的仆人就来，手拿三齿的叉子， ###EN### Nor did they regard the priests' rightful due with the people. When any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's attendant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the flesh was boiling,
Verse_Ch: 2:14 将叉子插入盆里，或鼎里，或釜里，或锅里；叉子所插上来的，祭司都取了去。凡到示罗来的以色列人，他们都是这样对待。 ###EN### And he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot; all that the fork brought up, the priest took with it. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.

Verse_Ch: 2:16 献祭的人若说，必须先烧脂油，然后你才可以随意取肉；仆人就说，你现在就给，不然我便抢去。 ###EN### And if the man said to him, Let them burn up the fat first, then take as much as your soul desires; he would say, No, but you shall give it now; otherwise, I will take it by force.
Verse_Ch: 2:17 如此，这两个少年人的罪在耶和华面前甚大，因为他们藐视耶和华的供物。 ###EN### And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.
Verse_Ch: 2:18 那时，撒母耳还是童子，束着细麻布的以弗得，在耶和华面前供职。 ###EN### And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.
Verse_Ch: 2:19 他母亲每年为他作一件小外袍，同着丈夫上来献年祭的时候带来给他。 ###EN### And his mother would make him a little robe and bring it up to him yearly when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
Verse_Ch: 2:20 以利为以利加拿和他的妻子祝福，说，愿耶和华由这妇人赐你后裔，代替她从耶和华求来的。他们就回本乡去了。 ###EN### And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, May Jehovah give you seed by this woman in place of the one she requested of Jehovah; and they would go back to their place.

Verse_Ch: 2:22 以利年甚老迈，听见他两个儿子待以色列众人的事，又听见他们与会幕门前服事的妇人苟合； ###EN### Now Eli was very old, and he heard of all that his sons did to all Israel and how they lay with the women who were engaged in service at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
Verse_Ch: 2:23 他就对他们说，你们为何行这样的事？我从这众百姓听见你们所行的恶事。 ###EN### And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
Verse_Ch: 2:24 我儿阿，不可这样；我听见耶和华百姓所传的风声不好。 ###EN### No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear Jehovah's people spreading.
Verse_Ch: 2:25 人若得罪人，有神为他作仲裁；人若得罪耶和华，有谁能为他作仲裁呢？然而他们还是不听父亲的话，因为耶和华想要杀他们。 ###EN### If one man sins against another man, God will arbitrate for him; but if a man sins against Jehovah, who will arbitrate for him? But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was pleased to kill them.
Verse_Ch: 2:26 童子撒母耳在身量上，并在耶和华与人对他的喜爱上，都不断增长。 ###EN### And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor both with Jehovah and with men.
Verse_Ch: 2:27 有神人来见以利，对他说，耶和华如此说，你父家在埃及法老家作奴仆的时候，我不是明明向他们显现么？ ###EN### And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, I revealed Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt as slaves to Pharaoh's house.
Verse_Ch: 2:28 在以色列众支派中，我不是拣选他们作我的祭司，使他们上我的坛，又向我烧香，并且在我面前穿着以弗得么？我不是将以色列人所献的火祭都赐给 你父家么？ ###EN### And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, and to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.
Verse_Ch: 2:29 我所吩咐献在我居所的祭物和供物，你们为何践踏呢？你为何尊重你的儿子过于尊重我，将我民以色列所献一切供物中上好的部分肥己呢？ ###EN### Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded in My habitation, and honor your sons more than Me by making yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?
Verse_Ch: 2:30 因此，耶和华以色列的神宣示说，我确实说过，你家和你父家必永远行在我面前；但现在我耶和华宣示说，我绝不容你们这样行。因为尊重我的，我 必尊重他们；藐视我的，他们必被轻视。 ###EN### Therefore Jehovah the God of Israel declares, I surely said that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever; but now Jehovah declares, Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who spurn Me will be lightly esteemed.
Verse_Ch: 2:31 日子要到，我必折断你的膀臂和你父家的膀臂，使你家中没有一个老年人。 ###EN### The days are now coming when I will cut off your arm and the arm of the house of your father, so that there will not be an old man in your house.
Verse_Ch: 2:32 在我使以色列人享各样好处的时候，你必看见我居所的败落；在你家中必永远没有一个老年人。 ###EN### And you shall see the distress of My habitation in the midst of all the good that I will do to Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.
Verse_Ch: 2:33 你家中未从我坛前被我剪除的人，必使你眼目失明，魂中忧伤。你家中所增加的人口都必死在人的刀下。 ###EN### And that man of yours whom I do not cut off from My altar shall be left to consume your eyes and to grieve your soul, and all the increase of your house shall die by the swords of men.
Verse_Ch: 2:34 你的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈所遭遇的事，要给你作兆头：他们二人必同日而死。 ###EN### And this will be the sign to you, which will come upon your two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: In one day both of them shall die.
Verse_Ch: 2:35 我要为自己立一个忠信的祭司；他必照我的心意而行。我要为他建立稳固的家；他必永远行在我的受膏者面前。 ###EN### And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he will go before My anointed continually.
Verse_Ch: 2:36 你家所剩余的人都必来叩拜他，求块银子，求个饼，说，求你使我有分于祭司的职任，好叫我得点饼吃。 ###EN### And everyone who is left of your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and for a loaf of bread, and will say, Please put me in one of the priests' offices that I may eat a morsel of bread.

Verse_Ch: 26:19 现在求我主我王听仆人的话：若是耶和华激动你攻击我，愿耶和华收纳祭物；若是人激动你，愿他们在耶和华面前受咒诅；因为他们今日赶逐我， 不容我在耶和华的产业上有分，说，你去事奉别神罢。 ###EN### Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.

Chapter_Header: 27
Verse_Ch: 27:1 大卫心里说，如今看来，必有一日我死在扫罗手里。我最好逃奔到非利士人的地去；扫罗就必绝望，不再在以色列的四境内寻索我。这样，我便可以 脱离他的手。 ###EN### And David said in his heart, I will now one day perish at the hand of Saul.

Verse_Ch: 27:5 大卫对亚吉说，我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你在乡间的一个城邑中赐我地方，我好居住在那里。仆人何必与王同住王城呢？ ###EN### And David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your sight, let me be given a place in one of the country towns; and I will dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?

Verse_Ch: 27:11 无论男女，大卫没有留下一个存活的带到迦特来；他心里说，恐怕他们将我们的事告诉人，说，大卫行了这样的事。大卫住在非利士人乡间的时候， 他惯常这样行。 ###EN### Now David left neither man nor woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he said, Perhaps they will tell of us, saying, Thus did David do. And such was his custom as long as he dwelt in the country of the Philistines.
