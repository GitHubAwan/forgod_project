Chapter_Header: 9
Verse_Ch: 9:1 这些事作完了，众首领来见我，说，以色列民和祭司并利未人，没有从四围各地诸民中分别出来，仍照他们可憎的事去行，就是照迦南人、赫人、比 利洗人、耶布斯人、亚扪人、摩押人、埃及人、亚摩利人可憎的事去行。 ###EN### Now when these things had been completed, the officials approached me, saying, The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
Verse_Ch: 9:2 因他们为自己和儿子娶了这些民的女子为妻，以致圣别的种类和这些地的诸民混杂；而且首领和官长在这不忠信的事上为魁首。 ###EN### For they have taken some of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands; indeed, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this unfaithfulness.
Verse_Ch: 9:3 我一听见这事，就撕裂衣服和外袍，拔了头发和胡须，惊惧忧闷而坐。 ###EN### And when I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled out hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled.
Verse_Ch: 9:4 凡为以色列神言语战兢的，都因这被掳归回之人的不忠信聚集到我这里来；我惊惧忧闷而坐，直到晚上献素祭的时候。 ###EN### Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of those of the captivity was gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening meal offering.
Verse_Ch: 9:5 晚上献素祭的时候，我从忧伤刻苦中起来，穿着撕裂的衣袍，双膝跪下，向耶和华我的神伸开双手祷告， ###EN### And at the time of the evening meal offering I rose up from my affliction, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God.
Verse_Ch: 9:6 说，我的神阿，我抱愧蒙羞，不敢向我的神仰面；因为我们的罪孽灭顶，我们的罪过滔天。 ###EN### And I said, O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have multiplied over our head, and our guilt has increased up to the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 9:7 从我们列祖的日子直到今日，我们的罪过甚大；因我们的罪孽，我们和我们的君王、祭司，都交在各地诸王的手中，被刀杀、掳掠、抢夺，脸上蒙羞， 正如今日的光景。 ###EN### Since the days of our fathers up to this day we have been exceedingly guilty; and because of our iniquities we, our kings and our priests, have been delivered up into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to shamefacedness, as it is this day.
Verse_Ch: 9:8 现在耶和华我们的神恩待我们片时，为我们留些逃脱的人，给我们安稳的钉子钉在祂的圣所，我们的神好光照我们的眼目，使我们在受辖制之中稍微 复兴。 ###EN### And now for a brief moment favor has been shown by Jehovah our God to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
Verse_Ch: 9:9 我们是奴仆，然而在受辖制之中，我们的神仍没有丢弃我们，在波斯诸王眼前向我们施慈爱，使我们复兴，能建立我们神的殿，修其荒废之处，并使 我们在犹大和耶路撒冷有墙垣。 ###EN### For we are slaves, yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to raise up the house of our God and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
Verse_Ch: 9:10 现在，我们的神阿，既是如此，我们还有什么话可说呢？因为我们已经离弃你的命令， ###EN### And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,
Verse_Ch: 9:11 就是你藉你仆人众申言者所吩咐的，说，你们要去得为业之地是污秽之地，有各地之民的污秽，和他们叫这地从这边直到那边所充满的可憎之事，还 有他们的不洁。 ###EN### Which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, The land which you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations, with which they have filled it from one end to another, and with their defilement.
Verse_Ch: 9:12 所以不可将你们的女儿嫁给他们的儿子，也不可为你们的儿子娶他们的女儿，永不可为他们求平安与好处，这样你们就可以强盛，吃这地的美物，并 遗留这地给你们的子孙永远为业。 ###EN### Now therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.
Verse_Ch: 9:13 我们因自己的恶行和大罪，遭遇了这一切的事，然而我们的神阿，你刑罚我们实在轻于我们的罪孽所当得的，又给我们留下这些逃脱的人； ###EN### And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that You our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us those who have escaped as this,
Verse_Ch: 9:14 我们岂可再背弃你的命令，与行这些可憎之事的民通婚呢？若这样行，你岂不向我们发怒，将我们灭绝，以致没有一个剩下逃脱的人么？ ###EN### Shall we again break your commandments and intermarry with the peoples that do these abominations? Will You not be angry with us until You have consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor any who escape?
Verse_Ch: 9:15 耶和华以色列的神阿，你是公义的，我们这剩下的人才得逃脱，正如今日的光景。我们在你面前有罪过，因此无人在你面前站立得住。 ###EN### O Jehovah the God of Israel, You are righteous; for we have been left a remnant of those who have escaped, as it is this day. Here we are before You in our guilt, although none can stand before You because of this.

Verse_Ch: 10:2 属以拦的子孙，耶歇的儿子示迦尼，对以斯拉说，我们对我们的神不忠信，娶了此地民中的外邦女子为妻，然而对于这事，以色列人还有指望。 ###EN### And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have acted unfaithfully against our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this.
Verse_Ch: 10:3 现在我们当与我们的神立约，将这一切妻子和她们所生的儿女送走，照着我主和那因我们神命令战兢之人所议定的，按律法而行。 ###EN### Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and those born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the law.
Verse_Ch: 10:4 你起来，这是你当办的事，我们必帮助你，你当刚强行事。 ###EN### Arise, for the matter is your responsibility, but we are with you; be strong, and do it.
Verse_Ch: 10:5 以斯拉便起来，使祭司、利未人、和以色列众人的首领起誓，要照这话去行；他们就起了誓。 ###EN### Then Ezra arose and made the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear that they would do according to this word; so they swore.
Verse_Ch: 10:6 以斯拉从神殿前起来，进入以利亚实的儿子约哈难的屋里；到了那里不吃饭，也不喝水，因他为那些被掳归回之人的不忠信悲伤。 ###EN### Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came there, he ate no bread and drank no water, for he was mourning because of the unfaithfulness of those of the captivity.
Verse_Ch: 10:7 他们在犹大和耶路撒冷通告所有被掳归回的人，叫他们在耶路撒冷聚集。 ###EN### And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;
Verse_Ch: 10:8 凡不照首领和长老所议定，在三日之内来到的，他所有的财物必被没收，他也必离开被掳归回之人的会。 ###EN### And that whoever did not come within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited, and he himself should be separated from the congregation of the captivity.
Verse_Ch: 10:9 于是，犹大和便雅悯众人，三日之内都聚集在耶路撒冷。那日正是九月二十日，众人都坐在神殿前的宽阔处；因这事，又因下大雨，就都战兢。 ###EN### Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month, and all the people sat in the open square in front of the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.
Verse_Ch: 10:10 祭司以斯拉站起来，对他们说，你们行事不忠信，娶了外邦的女子为妻，增添以色列人的罪过。 ###EN### And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, You have acted unfaithfully and have married foreign women to increase the guilt of Israel.
Verse_Ch: 10:11 现在当向耶和华你们列祖的神认罪，遵行祂的旨意，从这地的诸民和外邦的女子分别出来。 ###EN### Now therefore make confession to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do His will, and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women.
Verse_Ch: 10:12 会众都大声回答说，你说得对，我们必照着你的话行。 ###EN### Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, It is so; we must do as you have said.
Verse_Ch: 10:13 只是百姓众多，又逢大雨的时令，我们不能站在外头，这也不是一两天能办完的事，因我们在这事上犯了大罪； ###EN### But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside; neither is this a task for one day or two, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter.
Verse_Ch: 10:14 不如让我们的首领代表全会众办理这事，凡我们城邑中娶了外邦女子为妻的，当按所定的日期，同着本城的长老和士师而来，直到办完这事，使神 因这事所发的烈怒转离我们。 ###EN### Let our leaders represent the whole congregation, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and their judges, until the fierce anger of our God is turned away from us on account of this matter.
Verse_Ch: 10:15 惟有亚撒黑的儿子约拿单，特瓦的儿子雅哈谢阻挡这事，并有米书兰和利未人沙比太帮助他们。 ###EN### Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.
Verse_Ch: 10:16 被掳归回的人如此而行。祭司以斯拉和一些宗族的首领都按着宗族，指名被分别出来；在十月初一日，他们坐下来查办这事。 ###EN### And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers' houses were set apart according to their fathers' houses, all of them by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
Verse_Ch: 10:17 到正月初一日，他们才查出所有娶了外邦女子的人。 ###EN### And they finished with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
