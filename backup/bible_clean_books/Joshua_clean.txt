Verse_Ch: 5:6 以色列人在旷野走了四十年，直到国民，就是出埃及的兵丁，尽都消灭了，因为他们没有听从耶和华的话；耶和华曾向他们起誓，必不容他们看见耶 和华向他们列祖起誓要赐给我们的地，就是流奶与蜜之地。 ###EN### For the children of Israel went for forty years through the wilderness until all the nation, the men of war who had come out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, they to whom Jehovah swore that they would not see the land that Jehovah had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Verse_Ch: 5:7 他们的子孙，就是耶和华所兴起来接替他们的，约书亚给他们行了割礼；他们本没有受过割礼，因为在路上没有给他们行割礼。 ###EN### And their children, whom He had raised up in place of them, these Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.
Verse_Ch: 5:8 国民都受完了割礼，就住在营中自己的地方，等到痊愈了。 ###EN### And when they had finished circumcising the whole nation, they remained in their place at the camp until they recovered.
Verse_Ch: 5:9 耶和华对约书亚说，我今日将埃及的羞辱从你们身上辊去了。因此，那地方名叫吉甲，直到今日。 ###EN### Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. So the name of that place has been called Gilgal to this day.
Verse_Ch: 5:10 以色列人在吉甲安营；正月十四日晚上，他们在耶利哥的平原守逾越节。 ###EN### And the children of Israel camped in Gilgal; and they held the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho.
Verse_Ch: 5:11 逾越节的次日，他们就吃了那地的出产；正当那日，他们吃了无酵饼和烘的谷。 ###EN### And on the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
Verse_Ch: 5:12 他们吃了那地的出产，当日吗哪就止住了，以色列人也不再有吗哪了；那一年，他们却吃迦南地的出产。 ###EN### And the manna ceased on that day, when they ate of the produce of the land; and there was no longer manna for the children of Israel, but they ate of the yield of the land of Canaan that year.
Verse_Ch: 5:13 约书亚靠近耶利哥的时候，举目观看；看哪，有一个人手里有拔出来的刀，对面站立。约书亚到他那里，对他说，你是帮助我们呢，还是帮助我们的 敌人？ ###EN### Now once, when Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, there was a man standing opposite him, and His sword was drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us or for our adversaries?
Verse_Ch: 5:14 祂说，都不是，我现在来，是作耶和华军队的元帅。约书亚就面伏于地下拜，说，我主有什么话告诉仆人？ ###EN### And He said, Neither, but as the Captain of Jehovah's army have I now come. Then Joshua fell to the ground upon his face and worshipped. And he said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His servant?
