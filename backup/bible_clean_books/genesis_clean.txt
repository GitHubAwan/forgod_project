Verse_Ch: 31:25 拉班追上雅各。雅各在山地支搭帐棚；拉班和他的众弟兄也在基列山地支搭帐棚。 ###EN### And Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his brothers also pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.
Verse_Ch: 31:26 拉班对雅各说，你作的是什么事呢？你瞒着我逃走了，又把我的女儿们带走了，如同用刀剑掳去的一般。 ###EN### And Laban said to Jacob, What are you doing deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?
Verse_Ch: 31:27 你为什么暗暗的逃跑，偷着走，并不告诉我，叫我可以欢乐、唱歌、击鼓、弹琴来给你送行？ ###EN### Why did you flee secretly and steal away from me and not tell me, when I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with tambourine and with lyre?
Verse_Ch: 31:28 又不让我与外孙和女儿亲嘴？你所行的真是愚昧。 ###EN### And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have acted foolishly.
Verse_Ch: 31:29 我原有能力害你，只是你父亲的神昨夜对我说，你要小心，不可与雅各说好说歹。 ###EN### It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.
Verse_Ch: 31:30 现在你虽然很想你父家，不得不去，为什么又偷了我的神像呢？ ###EN### And now, though you had to go because you longed greatly for your father's house, why did you steal my gods?
Verse_Ch: 31:31 雅各回答拉班说，因为我害怕，以为你会把你的女儿从我手里夺去。 ###EN### And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I thought that you might take your daughters from me by force.
Verse_Ch: 31:32 至于你的神像，你在谁那里搜出来，谁就不得存活。当着我们的众弟兄，你认一认，在我这里有什么东西是你的，就拿去。原来雅各不知道拉结偷了那些神像。 ###EN### The one with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our brothers indicate what there is with me that is yours, and take it. Now Jacob did not
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: know that Rachel had stolen them.
Verse_Ch: 31:33 拉班进了雅各、利亚、并两个使女的帐棚，都没有搜出来，就从利亚的帐棚出来，进了拉结的帐棚。 ###EN### And Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the two female servants' tent, but he did not find them. Then he went from Leah's tent and entered
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: Rachel's tent.
Verse_Ch: 31:34 拉结已经把神像藏在骆驼的驮篓里，并且坐在上头。拉班摸遍了那帐棚，并没有摸着。 ###EN### Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel's saddle, and she sat upon them. And Laban rummaged through all the tent but did not
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: find them.
Verse_Ch: 31:35 拉结对她父亲说，现在我身上不便，不能在你面前起来，求我主不要动怒。这样，拉班搜寻神像，竟没有搜出来。 ###EN### And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before you, for the manner of women is upon me. So he searched but did not find the
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: household idols.
Verse_Ch: 31:36 雅各就发怒，与拉班争论，说，我有什么过犯，有什么罪，你竟这样火速的追我？ ###EN### And Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have so hotly
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: pursued me?
Verse_Ch: 31:37 你摸遍了我一切的物件，搜出什么是你家的东西呢？可以放在你我的弟兄们面前，叫他们在我们二人中间判断判断。 ###EN### Although you have rummaged through all my possessions, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers,
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: that they may decide between the two of us.
Verse_Ch: 31:38 我同你在一起这二十年，你的母绵羊、母山羊没有掉过胎；你群中的公羊，我没有吃过； ###EN### These twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
Verse_Ch: 31:39 被野兽撕裂的，我没有带来给你，是我自己赔上。无论是白日，是黑夜，被偷去的，你都向我索要。 ###EN### That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Verse_Ch: 31:40 我白日受干热销磨，黑夜受寒霜侵蚀，不得合眼睡着，我常是这样。 ###EN### Thus I was: By day the dry heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
Verse_Ch: 31:41 我这二十年在你家里，为你的两个女儿服事你十四年，为你的羊群服事你六年，你十次改了我的工价。 ###EN### These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: ten times.
Verse_Ch: 31:42 若不是我父亲的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒所敬畏的神与我同在，你如今必定打发我空手而去。神看见我的苦情和我的劳碌，就在昨夜责备你。 ###EN### If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had not been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.
Verse_Ch: 31:43 拉班回答雅各说，女儿是我的女儿，孩子是我的孩子，羊群也是我的羊群；凡在你眼前的都是我的。我的女儿并她们所生的孩子，我今日能向他们作什么呢？ ###EN### And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?
Verse_Ch: 31:44 来罢，你我二人可以立约，作你我中间的证据。 ###EN### So come now; let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be a witness between me and you.
Verse_Ch: 31:45 雅各就拿一块石头，立作柱子， ###EN### So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Verse_Ch: 31:46 又对众弟兄说，你们捡聚石头。他们就拿石头来堆成一堆，大家便在旁边吃喝。 ###EN### And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones. So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
Verse_Ch: 31:47 拉班称那石堆为伊迦尔撒哈杜他，雅各却称那石堆为迦累得。 ###EN### And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
Verse_Ch: 31:48 拉班说，今日这石堆作你我中间的证据。因此那地方名叫迦累得， ###EN### And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you today. Therefore its name was called Galeed
Verse_Ch: 31:49 又叫米斯巴，因为他说，我们彼此离别以后，愿耶和华在你我中间鉴察。 ###EN### And Mizpah, because he said, Jehovah watch between me and you when we are absent from one another.
Verse_Ch: 31:50 你若苦待我的女儿，又在我的女儿以外另娶妻子，虽然没有人同我们在一起，却有神在你我中间作见证。 ###EN### If you afflict my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters-even though no man is with us-see, God is witness between me and you.
Verse_Ch: 31:51 拉班又对雅各说，你看这石堆，和我在你我中间所立的柱子。 ###EN### And Laban said to Jacob, Here is this heap, and here is the pillar which I have set between me and you.
Verse_Ch: 31:52 这石堆作证据，这柱子也作证据；我必不过这石堆去害你，你也不可过这石堆和柱子来害我。 ###EN### This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you and that you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: harm.
Verse_Ch: 31:53 但愿亚伯拉罕的神和拿鹤的神，就是他们父亲的神，在你我中间判断。雅各就指着他父亲以撒所敬畏的神起誓， ###EN### The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac.
Verse_Ch: 31:54 又在山上献祭，请众弟兄来吃饭。他们吃了饭，便在山上过夜。 ###EN### And Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his brothers to eat a meal, and they ate a meal and spent the night in the mountain.
Verse_Ch: 31:55 拉班清早起来，与他外孙和女儿亲嘴，给他们祝福，就离开那里，回自己的地方去了。 ###EN### And early in the morning Laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them, and Laban departed and returned to his place.
Chapter_Header: 32
Verse_Ch: 32:1 雅各仍旧行路，神的众使者遇见他。 ###EN### And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Verse_Ch: 32:2 雅各看见他们就说，这是神的军营，于是给那地方起名叫玛哈念。 ###EN### And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's camp. So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
Verse_Ch: 32:3 雅各打发报信的人先往西珥地，以东乡间，见他哥哥以扫； ###EN### And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
Verse_Ch: 32:4 他吩咐他们说，你们要对我主以扫这样说：你的仆人雅各这样说，我在拉班那里寄居，直留到如今。 ###EN### And he commanded them, saying, Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now;
Verse_Ch: 32:5 我有牛、驴、羊群、仆人、婢女，现在打发人来报告我主，为要在你眼前蒙恩。 ###EN### And I have oxen and donkeys and flocks, and male servants and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord this, that I may find favor in your sight.

Verse_Ch: 32:7 雅各就甚惧怕，而且愁烦，便把那与他同在的人口和羊群、牛群、骆驼分作两队， ###EN### Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two camps;
Verse_Ch: 32:8 说，以扫若来击杀这一队，剩下的那一队还可以逃避。 ###EN### And he said, If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp which is left will escape.
Verse_Ch: 32:9 雅各说，耶和华我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神阿，你曾对我说，回你本地，到你亲族那里去，我要善待你。 ###EN### Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will do
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: you good,
Verse_Ch: 32:10 你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和信实，我一点也不配得；我先前只拿着我的杖过这约但河，如今我却成了两队。 ###EN### I am not worthy of all the lovingkindnesses and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant, for with my staff only I crossed over this Jordan, and
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: now I have become two camps.
Verse_Ch: 32:11 求你救我脱离我哥哥以扫的手；因为我怕他来击杀我，连妻子带儿女一同击杀了。 ###EN### Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack me, even the mother with the children.
Verse_Ch: 32:12 你曾说，我必定善待你，使你的后裔如同海沙，多得不可胜数。 ###EN### But You have said, I will surely do you good and make your seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
Verse_Ch: 32:13 当夜，雅各在那里住宿，就从他所有的物中拿礼物要送给他哥哥以扫： ###EN### And he spent that night there. Then from what he had with him he took a present for Esau his brother:
Verse_Ch: 32:14 母山羊二百只，公山羊二十只，母绵羊二百只，公绵羊二十只， ###EN### Two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
Verse_Ch: 32:15 奶崽子的骆驼三十只，各带着崽子，母牛四十只，公牛十只，母驴二十匹，公驴十匹； ###EN### Thirty nursing camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
Verse_Ch: 32:16 每样各分一群，交在仆人手下，就对仆人说，你们要在我前头过去，使一群一群之间有个距离； ###EN### And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Cross over before me, and put a space between each drove.
Verse_Ch: 32:17 又吩咐尽先走的说，我哥哥以扫遇见你的时候，问你说，你是那家的人？要往那里去？你前头这些牲畜是谁的？ ###EN### And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: whose animals are these before you?
Verse_Ch: 32:18 你就说，是你仆人雅各的，是送给我主以扫的礼物；他自己也在我们后边。 ###EN### Then you will say, Your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau; and now he also is behind us.
Verse_Ch: 32:19 又吩咐第二、第三、和一切赶群畜的人说，你们遇见以扫的时候，也要这样对他说； ###EN### And he commanded also the second and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him,
Verse_Ch: 32:20 并且你们要说，你仆人雅各就在我们后边。因为雅各心里说，我借着在我前头去的礼物解他的恨，然后再见他的面，或者他会接纳我。 ###EN### And you shall also say, Your servant Jacob is right behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: face; perhaps he will accept me.
Verse_Ch: 32:21 于是礼物在他前头过去了；那夜，他在队中住宿。 ###EN### So the present crossed over before him, and he himself spent that night in the camp.
Verse_Ch: 32:22 他夜间起来，带着两个妻子，两个使女，并十一个儿子，过雅博渡口。 ###EN### And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two female servants and his eleven children and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.
Verse_Ch: 32:23 他带着他们，打发他们过河，又打发所有的都过去。 ###EN### And he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.
Verse_Ch: 32:24 只剩下雅各一人，有一个人和他摔跤，直到黎明。 ###EN### And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.
Verse_Ch: 32:25 那人见自己胜不过他，就将他的大腿窝摸了一把；雅各正与那人摔跤的时候，他的大腿窝就脱了节。 ###EN### And when the man saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: Him.
Verse_Ch: 32:26 那人说，天快亮了，让我去罢。雅各却说，你若不给我祝福，我就不让你去。 ###EN### And the man said, Let Me go, for the dawn is breaking. But Jacob said, I will not let You go unless You bless me.
Verse_Ch: 32:27 那人对他说，你名叫什么？他说，我名叫雅各。 ###EN### And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.
Verse_Ch: 32:28 那人说，你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列；因为你与神与人较力，都得了胜。 ###EN### And He said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.
Verse_Ch: 32:29 雅各问祂说，请将你的名告诉我。但那人说，你何必问我的名？于是祂在那里给雅各祝福。 ###EN### And Jacob asked Him and said, Please tell me Your name. But He said, Why is it that you ask My name? And He blessed him there.
Verse_Ch: 32:30 雅各便给那地方起名叫毗努伊勒，因为他说，我面对面看见了神，我的性命仍得保全。 ###EN### And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, he said, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved.
Verse_Ch: 32:31 日头升起，照在雅各身上，那时他渡过毗努伊勒，他的大腿就瘸了。 ###EN### And the sun rose upon him as he crossed over Penuel, and he limped because of his hip.
Verse_Ch: 32:32 故此，以色列人不吃大腿窝的筋，直到今日，因为那人摸了雅各大腿窝的筋。 ###EN### Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle, which is upon the socket of the hip, to this day, because He touched the socket of Jacob's hip at the
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: thigh muscle.
Chapter_Header: 33
Verse_Ch: 33:1 雅各举目观看，见以扫来了，同他一起的有四百人。他就把孩子们分开交给利亚、拉结、和两个使女， ###EN### And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and there was Esau coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and among
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: Rachel and among the two female servants.
Verse_Ch: 33:2 并且叫两个使女和她们的孩子在前面，利亚和她的孩子在后面，拉结和约瑟在最后面。 ###EN### And he put the female servants and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
Verse_Ch: 33:3 他自己在他们前头过去，一连七次俯伏在地，直到就近他哥哥。 ###EN### And he himself passed on before them and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.
Verse_Ch: 33:4 以扫跑来迎接他，将他抱住，又伏在他的颈项上，与他亲嘴，两个人就哭了。 ###EN### And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
Verse_Ch: 33:5 以扫举目看见妇人孩子，就说，这些和你同行的是谁？雅各说，这些孩子是神施恩给你仆人的。 ###EN### And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: servant.
Verse_Ch: 33:6 于是两个使女和她们的孩子前来下拜； ###EN### Then the female servants came near, they and their children, and they bowed down.
Verse_Ch: 33:7 利亚和她的孩子也前来下拜；随后约瑟和拉结也前来下拜。 ###EN### And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down.
Verse_Ch: 33:8 以扫说，我所遇见的这一整队是什么意思？雅各说，是要在我主眼前蒙恩的。 ###EN### And Esau said, What do you mean by all this camp which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
Verse_Ch: 33:9 以扫说，弟弟阿，我的已经够了，你的仍归你罢。 ###EN### And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let what you have be yours.
Verse_Ch: 33:10 雅各说，不然，我若在你眼前蒙恩，就求你从我手里收下这礼物；因为我看见你的面，如同看见神的面，并且你悦纳了我。 ###EN### And Jacob said, No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand; for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: have received me favorably.
Verse_Ch: 33:11 求你收下我带来给你的礼物；因为神恩待了我，并且我一切都有了。雅各再三的求他，他才收下了。 ###EN### Please take my blessing which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have all that I need. So he urged him, and he
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: took it.
Verse_Ch: 33:12 以扫说，我们可以起身前去，我要在你前头走。 ###EN### Then Esau said, Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you.
Verse_Ch: 33:13 雅各对他说，我主知道孩子们年幼娇嫩，正在乳养的牛羊也是我所挂心的，若是催赶一天，群畜都必死了。 ###EN### And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are frail and that the nursing flocks and herds are a concern to me; and if they overdrive them for one day, all
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: the flock will die.
Verse_Ch: 33:14 求我主在仆人前头走，我要按着在我前面群畜和孩子们的步速慢慢前行，直走到西珥我主那里。 ###EN### Let my lord please pass on before his servant, and I will lead on slowly according to the pace of the cattle which are before me and according to the pace of the
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: children until I come to my lord at Seir.
Verse_Ch: 33:15 以扫说，让我把跟随我的人留几个在你这里。雅各说，何必呢？只要在我主眼前蒙恩就是了。 ###EN### So Esau said, Let me please leave with you some of the people who are with me. And he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
Verse_Ch: 33:16 于是，以扫当日起行，回西珥去了。 ###EN### So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Verse_Ch: 33:17 雅各就往疏割去，在那里为自己盖造一座房屋，又为牲畜搭棚；因此那地方名叫疏割。 ###EN### And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built a house for himself and made booths for his livestock; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
Verse_Ch: 33:18 雅各从巴旦亚兰回来的时候，平平安安的到了迦南地的示剑城，在城对面支搭帐棚， ###EN### And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and he camped before the city.
Verse_Ch: 33:19 就用一百块银子向示剑的父亲哈抹的子孙，买了支帐棚的那块地， ###EN### And he bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred qesitahs.

Verse_Ch: 34:6 示剑的父亲哈抹出来见雅各，要和他商议。 ###EN### And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
Verse_Ch: 34:7 雅各的儿子们听见这事，就从田野回来，人人悲愤，极其恼怒；因为示剑在以色列家作了愚妄的事，与雅各的女儿同寝，这本是不该作的事。 ###EN### And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard of it. And the men were grieved and became very angry, because he had committed folly in Israel

Verse_Ch: 34:18 哈抹和他的儿子示剑认为这话甚好。 ###EN### And their words seemed good to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.
Verse_Ch: 34:19 那少年人作这事并不迟延，因为他喜爱雅各的女儿；他在他父亲家中也是人最尊重的。 ###EN### And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now he was honored above all the house of his father.
Verse_Ch: 34:20 哈抹和他儿子示剑到本城的门口，对本城的人说， ###EN### And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city and spoke with the men of their city, saying,

Verse_Ch: 41:50 荒年未到以前，安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳，给约瑟生了两个儿子。 ###EN### And before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.

Verse_Ch: 42:1 雅各见埃及有粮，就对儿子们说，你们为什么彼此观望呢？ ###EN### Now when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do you keep looking at one another?
Verse_Ch: 42:2 我听见埃及有粮，你们可以下去，从那里为我们买些来，使我们可以存活，不至于死。 ###EN### And he said, I have now heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there, and buy grain for us from there, that we may live and not die.
Verse_Ch: 42:3 于是，约瑟的十个哥哥都下埃及买粮去了。 ###EN### So Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Verse_Ch: 42:4 但雅各没有打发约瑟的弟弟便雅悯与他哥哥们同去，因为雅各说，恐怕他遭害。 ###EN### But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, Perhaps harm may befall him.
Verse_Ch: 42:5 来买粮的人中有以色列的儿子们，因为迦南地也有饥荒。 ###EN### And the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who also came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Verse_Ch: 42:6 当时治理埃及地的是约瑟；卖粮给那地众民的就是他。约瑟的哥哥们来了，面伏于地，向他下拜。 ###EN### Now Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold grain to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him with

Verse_Ch: 42:8 约瑟认得他哥哥们，他们却不认得他。 ###EN### And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
Verse_Ch: 42:9 约瑟想起从前所作关于他们的那两个梦，就对他们说，你们是奸细，来窥探这地的虚实。 ###EN### And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.
Verse_Ch: 42:10 他们对他说，我主阿，不是的，仆人们是来买粮食的。 ###EN### And they said to him, No, my lord; rather your servants have come to buy grain for food.
Verse_Ch: 42:11 我们都是一个人的儿子，是诚实人；仆人们从来没有作过奸细。 ###EN### We are all sons of one man. We are honest men; your servants have never been spies.
Verse_Ch: 42:12 约瑟说，不然，你们必是来窥探这地虚实的。 ###EN### And he said to them, No; but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.
Verse_Ch: 42:13 他们说，仆人们本是弟兄十二人，是迦南地一个人的儿子，最小的现今在我们的父亲那里，还有一个没有了。 ###EN### And they said, We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and at this moment the youngest is with our father today, and
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: one is no more.
Verse_Ch: 42:14 约瑟说，我才说你们是奸细，这话实在不错。 ###EN### But Joseph said to them, It is just as I spoke to you, saying, You are spies.
Verse_Ch: 42:15 我指着法老的性命起誓，若是你们最小的弟弟不到这里来，你们就不得出这地方，藉此就可以把你们试验出来了。 ###EN### By this you shall be tested: As Pharaoh lives, you shall not go away from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
Verse_Ch: 42:16 要打发你们中间一个人去，把你们的弟弟带来。至于你们，都要囚在这里，好试验你们的话真不真；若不真，我指着法老的性命起誓，你们必定是奸细。 ###EN### Send one of you to get your brother, while you remain bound, that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you. And if not, as Pharaoh lives, surely you
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: are spies.
Verse_Ch: 42:17 于是约瑟把他们一起拘禁了三天。 ###EN### And he put them all together in custody three days.
Verse_Ch: 42:18 到第三天，约瑟对他们说，我是敬畏神的；你们照我的话行，就可以存活。 ###EN### And Joseph said to them on the third day, Do this and live, for I fear God.
Verse_Ch: 42:19 你们如果是诚实人，可以留你们弟兄中的一个，囚在你们拘禁的地方，但你们其余的可以带着粮回去，救你们家里的饥荒。 ###EN### If you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain bound in your place of custody; and the rest of you go, carry grain for the famine of your households.
Verse_Ch: 42:20 把你们最小的弟弟带到我这里来，如此，你们的话便得证实，你们也不至于死。他们就这样行。 ###EN### And bring your youngest brother to me, that your words may be verified; and you will not die. And they did so.
Verse_Ch: 42:21 他们彼此说，我们对我们的弟弟实在有罪。他哀求我们的时候，我们见他魂里的痛苦，却不肯听，所以这场苦难临到了我们。 ###EN### And they said one to another, We are indeed guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: listen; therefore this distress has come to us.
Verse_Ch: 42:22 流便说，我岂不是对你们说过，不可犯罪害那孩子么？只是你们不肯听，所以流他血的罪现在向我们追讨。 ###EN### And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the child? But you would not listen. So now also his blood is required.
Verse_Ch: 42:23 他们不知道约瑟听得懂，因为在他们中间有传译的人。 ###EN### And they did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.
Verse_Ch: 42:24 约瑟转身退去，哭了一场，又回来对他们说话。他从他们中间挑出西缅来，在他们眼前把他捆绑了。 ###EN### And he turned away from them and wept. Then he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes.
Verse_Ch: 42:25 约瑟吩咐人把谷物装满他们的器皿，把各人的银子归还在各人的粮袋里，又给他们路上用的食物；人就照他的话办了。 ###EN### Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man's silver pieces into his sack and to give them provisions for the way. And thus was it
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: done for them.
Verse_Ch: 42:26 他们就把粮驮在驴上，离开那里去了。 ###EN### And they loaded their grain upon their donkeys and departed from there.
Verse_Ch: 42:27 到了住宿的地方，他们中间有一个人打开粮袋，要拿饲粮喂驴，才看见自己的银子仍在袋口； ###EN### And one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, and he saw his silver; there it was in the mouth of his sack.
Verse_Ch: 42:28 就对弟兄们说，我的银子归还了，看哪，仍在我袋子里。他们就提心吊胆，战战兢兢的彼此说，这是神向我们作什么呢？ ###EN### And he said to his brothers, My silver has been returned; and here it is in my sack! And their heart stopped, and they turned trembling to one another, saying,
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: What is this that God has done to us?
Verse_Ch: 42:29 他们来到迦南地他们的父亲雅各那里，将所遭遇的事都告诉他，说， ###EN### And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying,
Verse_Ch: 42:30 那人，那地的主，对我们说严厉的话，把我们当作窥探那地的奸细。 ###EN### The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and took us for spies on the land.
Verse_Ch: 42:31 我们对他说，我们是诚实人，从来没有作过奸细。 ###EN### But we said to him, We are honest men; we have never been spies.
Verse_Ch: 42:32 我们本是弟兄十二人，都是一个父亲的儿子，有一个没有了，最小的如今同我们的父亲在迦南地。 ###EN### We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; the one is no more, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.
Verse_Ch: 42:33 那人，那地的主，对我们说，若要我知道你们是诚实人，可以留下你们弟兄中的一个在我这里，你们带着粮食回去，救你们家里的饥荒。 ###EN### And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this will I know that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: your households, and go.
Verse_Ch: 42:34 把你们最小的弟弟带到我这里来，我便知道你们不是奸细，乃是诚实人。这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们，你们也可以在这地作买卖。 ###EN### And bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies but are honest men. I will give you your brother, and you may trade in the land.
Verse_Ch: 42:35 后来他们倒粮袋，不料，各人的银包都在粮袋里；他们和父亲看见银包就都害怕。 ###EN### And when they emptied their sacks, there was each man's bundle of silver pieces, in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of silver, they
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: were afraid.
Verse_Ch: 42:36 他们的父亲雅各对他们说，你们使我丧失我的儿子：约瑟没有了，西缅也没有了，你们又要将便雅悯带去；这些事都落到我身上了。 ###EN### And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: things are against me.
Verse_Ch: 42:37 流便对他父亲说，我若不带他回来交给你，你可以杀我的两个儿子。只管把他交在我手里，我必带他回来交给你。 ###EN### And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, You may put to death my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Put him in my hand, and I will return him to you.
Verse_Ch: 42:38 雅各说，我的儿子不可与你们一同下去；他哥哥死了，只剩下他，他若在你们所行的路上遭害，那便是你们使我白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨的下阴间去了。 ###EN### But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. And if harm should befall him on the way in which you go, then you
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.
Chapter_Header: 43
Verse_Ch: 43:1 那地的饥荒甚重。 ###EN### Now the famine was severe in the land.

Verse_Ch: 43:3 但犹大对他说，那人郑重的警告我们说，你们的弟弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。 ###EN### But Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly warned us, saying, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
Verse_Ch: 43:4 你若愿意打发我们的弟弟与我们同去，我们就下去给你买粮食； ###EN### If you are willing to send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you grain for food;
Verse_Ch: 43:5 你若不愿意打发他去，我们就不下去，因为那人对我们说，你们的弟弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。 ###EN### But if you are not willing to send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
Verse_Ch: 43:6 以色列说，你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有弟弟呢？ ###EN### And Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?
Verse_Ch: 43:7 他们说，那人详细的问到我们和我们的亲属，说，你们的父亲还健在么？你们还有兄弟么？我们就按着他所问的告诉他。我们怎能知道他会说，把你们的弟弟带下来呢？ ###EN### And they said, The man asked very carefully about us and about our relatives, saying, Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother? So we told him about
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: these things. Could we possibly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Verse_Ch: 43:8 犹大又对他父亲以色列说，你打发少年人与我同去，我们就起身下去，好叫我们和你，并我们的妇人孩子，都得存活，不至于死。 ###EN### And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the boy with me, and we will rise up and go, that we may live and not die, we and you and our little ones.
Verse_Ch: 43:9 我为他作保，你可以从我手中追讨。我若不带他回来交在你面前，我就永远在你面前担罪。 ###EN### I myself will be surety for him; of my hand you may require him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then I shall bear the blame of sinning before
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: you forever.
Verse_Ch: 43:10 我们若没有耽搁，如今第二次都回来了。 ###EN### For if we had not delayed, by now we could have returned twice.
Verse_Ch: 43:11 他们的父亲以色列对他们说，若必须如此，你们就当这样行：可以取些这地佳美的出产，就是一点香油和一点蜂蜜、香胶和没药，榧子和杏仁，收在器皿里，带下去送给那人作礼物； ###EN### And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man-a
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.
Verse_Ch: 43:12 又要手里带着加倍的银子，并要将归还在你们袋口的银子带回去；那或者是错了。 ###EN### And take double the silver in your hand, and carry back in your hand the silver that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.
Verse_Ch: 43:13 也带着你们的弟弟，起身回去见那人。 ###EN### Take your brother also, and rise up. Return to the man,
Verse_Ch: 43:14 但愿全足的神在那人面前赐你们怜悯，使他释放你们的那弟兄和便雅悯回来。至于我，我若丧了儿子，就丧了罢。 ###EN### And may the All-sufficient God grant you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am to be

Verse_Ch: 43:15 于是，他们拿着礼物，手里带着加倍的银子，并且带着便雅悯，起身下到埃及，站在约瑟面前。 ###EN### So the men took this present, and they took double the silver in their hand and Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
Verse_Ch: 43:16 约瑟见便雅悯和他们同来，就对家宰说，将这些人领到屋里，要宰杀牲畜，预备筵席，因为正午这些人要同我吃饭。 ###EN### And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to him who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and prepare it; for
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: the men will eat with me at noon.
Verse_Ch: 43:17 家宰就遵着约瑟的命去行，领他们进约瑟的屋里。 ###EN### And the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
Verse_Ch: 43:18 他们因为被领到约瑟的屋里，就害怕，说，必是因为头次归还在我们袋子里的银子，才领我们到这里来，要找机会下手害我们，强取我们作奴仆，抢夺我们的驴。 ###EN### And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, It is because of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, that
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: we are being brought in, that he may come out against us and fall upon us and take us as slaves with our donkeys.
Verse_Ch: 43:19 他们就挨近约瑟的家宰，在屋门口和他说话， ###EN### And they came near to the man who was over Joseph's house and spoke to him at the door of the house,
Verse_Ch: 43:20 说，我主阿，我们头次下来实在是要买粮食。 ###EN### And said, Please, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy grain for food;
Verse_Ch: 43:21 后来到了住宿的地方，我们打开袋子，不料，各人的银子分量足数，仍在各人的袋口；现在我们手里又带回来了。 ###EN### And when we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and there was each man's silver, in the mouth of his sack, our silver in full weight. So we have
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: brought it back in our hand.
Verse_Ch: 43:22 我们手里还另外带下银子来买粮食。我们不知道先前谁把银子放在我们的袋子里。 ###EN### And we have also brought down extra silver in our hand to buy grain for food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.
Verse_Ch: 43:23 家宰说，你们可以放心，不要害怕，是你们的神和你们父亲的神，赐给你们财宝在你们的袋子里；你们的银子，我早已收了。他就把西缅带出来，交给他们。 ###EN### And he said, Be at peace; do not fear. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me. Then he brought Simeon
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: out to them.
Verse_Ch: 43:24 家宰就领他们进约瑟的屋里，给他们水洗脚，又给他们饲粮喂驴。 ###EN### And the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.

Verse_Ch: 43:26 约瑟来到家里，他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他，又俯伏在地，向他下拜。 ###EN### And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down to the ground to him.

Verse_Ch: 43:31 他洗了脸出来，勉强忍住，吩咐人摆饭。 ###EN### Then he washed his face and came out, and he controlled himself and said, Serve the meal.
Verse_Ch: 43:32 他们就为约瑟单摆了一席，为那些人又摆了一席，也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人另摆了一席，因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭；那原是埃及人所厌恶的。 ###EN### And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat a meal with

UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: we die in your presence? For our money is gone.
Verse_Ch: 47:16 约瑟说，若是银子用尽了，可以把你们的牲畜带来，我就给你们粮食，来换你们的牲畜。 ###EN### And Joseph said, Bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.
Verse_Ch: 47:17 于是他们把牲畜赶到约瑟那里，约瑟就拿粮食换了他们的马、羊群、牛群和驴；那一年因换他们一切的牲畜，就用粮食养活他们。 ###EN### And they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and for the flocks of sheep and for the herds of cattle and for
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
Verse_Ch: 47:18 那一年过去，第二年他们又来见约瑟，说，我们不瞒我主，我们的银子都花尽了，牲畜也都归了我主。我们在我主眼前，除了我们的身体和田地之外，一无所剩。 ###EN### And when that year had ended, they came to him the second year and said to him, We cannot hide from my lord that our money has been spent, and the herds
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: of cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord except our bodies and our lands.
Verse_Ch: 47:19 我们为什么要在你面前人死地荒呢？求你用粮食买我们和我们的地，我们和我们的地就要给法老效力；并且求你给我们种子，使我们得以存活，不至死亡，地土也不至荒凉。 ###EN### Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh.
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.
Verse_Ch: 47:20 于是约瑟为法老买了埃及所有的地；埃及人因被饥荒所迫，各都卖了自己的田地；那地就都归了法老。 ###EN### So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.
Verse_Ch: 47:21 至于百姓，约瑟叫他们从埃及境内的这边直到那边，都迁移到各城里。 ###EN### And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end.
Verse_Ch: 47:22 惟有祭司的地，约瑟没有买，因为祭司有从法老所得的常俸。他们吃法老所给的常俸，所以他们不卖自己的地。 ###EN### Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and they lived off their portion which Pharaoh gave them;
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: therefore they did not sell their land.
Verse_Ch: 47:23 那时约瑟对百姓说，看哪，我今日为法老买了你们和你们的地；这里有种子给你们，你们可以种地。 ###EN### Then Joseph said to the people, Now that I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you that you may sow the land.
Verse_Ch: 47:24 到收割的时候，你们要把五分之一纳给法老，五分之四可以归你们自己作田地里的种子，也作你们、你们家人和孩童的食物。 ###EN### And when harvest comes, you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own as seed of the field and as food for you and for those of your
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: households and as food for your little ones.
Verse_Ch: 47:25 他们说，你救了我们的性命。但愿我们在我主眼前蒙恩，我们就作法老的仆人。 ###EN### And they said, You have saved our lives. May we find favor in the sight of my lord and be Pharaoh's servants.
Verse_Ch: 47:26 于是约瑟为埃及的地立下定例，直到今日：法老必得五分之一，惟独祭司的地不归法老。 ###EN### And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt that stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone did not
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: become Pharaoh's.
Verse_Ch: 47:27 以色列人住在埃及的歌珊地；他们在那里置了产业，并且极其繁衍增多。 ###EN### And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.
Verse_Ch: 47:28 雅各住在埃及地十七年，雅各平生的年日是一百四十七岁。 ###EN### And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. Thus the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.
Verse_Ch: 47:29 以色列的死期临近了，他就叫了他儿子约瑟来，说，我若在你眼前蒙恩，请你把手放在我大腿下起誓；用恩慈和诚信待我，请你不要将我葬在埃及。 ###EN### And the time for Israel to die drew near. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth; please do not bury me in Egypt.
Verse_Ch: 47:30 我与我祖我父同睡的时候，你要将我带出埃及，葬在他们所葬的地方。约瑟说，我必遵着你的话而行。 ###EN### But when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.
Verse_Ch: 47:31 雅各说，你要向我起誓。约瑟就向他起了誓，于是以色列在床头上敬拜神。 ###EN### And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself at the head of his bed.

Verse_Ch: 48:1 这些事以后，有人告诉约瑟说，你的父亲病了。他就带着两个儿子玛拿西和以法莲同去。 ###EN### Now after these things Joseph was told, Your father is now sick. So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Verse_Ch: 48:2 有人告诉雅各说，请看，你儿子约瑟到你这里来了。以色列就勉强在床上坐起来。 ###EN### And someone told Jacob and said, Your son Joseph is now coming to you. So Israel strengthened himself and sat up on his bed.
Verse_Ch: 48:3 雅各对约瑟说，全足的神曾在迦南地的路斯向我显现，赐福与我， ###EN### And Jacob said to Joseph, The All-sufficient God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.
Verse_Ch: 48:4 对我说，我必使你繁衍增多，成为多族，又要把这地赐给你的后裔，永远为业。 ###EN### And He said to me, Behold, I am going to make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your seed
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: after you for an everlasting possession.
Verse_Ch: 48:5 我未到埃及见你之前，你在埃及地所生的两个儿子是我的；以法莲和玛拿西是我的，正如流便和西缅是我的一样。 ###EN### And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, as Reuben and
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: Simeon are.
Verse_Ch: 48:6 你在他们以后所生的就是你的，他们可以归于他们哥哥们的名下承继产业。 ###EN### And your offspring whom you beget after them will be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
Verse_Ch: 48:7 至于我，我从巴旦来的时候，在迦南地的路上，离以法他还有一段路程，拉结在我悲痛中死了；我就把她葬在通往以法他的路旁(以法他就是伯利恒。) ###EN### And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, while there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
Verse_Ch: 48:8 以色列看见约瑟的两个儿子，就说，这两个是谁？ ###EN### And when Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, Who are these?
Verse_Ch: 48:9 约瑟对他父亲说，他们是神在这里赐给我的儿子。以色列说，请你领他们到我跟前，我要给他们祝福。 ###EN### And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given to me here. And he said, Bring them to me, that I may bless them.
Verse_Ch: 48:10 以色列年纪老迈，眼睛昏花，不能看见；约瑟领他们挨近他，他就和他们亲嘴，抱着他们。 ###EN### Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, and he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
Verse_Ch: 48:11 以色列对约瑟说，我想不到得见你的面，不料，神又使我得见你的后裔。 ###EN### And Israel said to Joseph, I never expected to see your face, and now God has let me see your seed also.
Verse_Ch: 48:12 约瑟把两个儿子从以色列两膝中领出来，自己面伏于地下拜。 ###EN### And Joseph brought them out from between his knees and bowed himself with his face to the ground.
Verse_Ch: 48:13 随后约瑟又拉着他们两个，以法莲在他的右手里，对着以色列的左手；玛拿西在他的左手里，对着以色列的右手；领他们挨近以色列。 ###EN### And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: to him.
Verse_Ch: 48:14 但以色列伸出右手来，按在以法莲的头上(以法莲乃是次子，)又剪搭过左手来，按在玛拿西的头上(玛拿西原是长子。) ###EN### But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim's head-although he was the younger-and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: hands with insight, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.
Verse_Ch: 48:15 他就给约瑟祝福说，愿我祖亚伯拉罕和我父以撒行事为人都在祂面前的神，就是一生牧养我直到今日的神， ###EN### And he blessed Joseph and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day,

UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: may they be a teeming multitude in the midst of the earth.
Verse_Ch: 48:17 约瑟见他父亲把右手按在以法莲的头上，就不喜悦，便提起他父亲的手，要从以法莲的头上挪到玛拿西的头上。 ###EN### And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: Ephraim's head onto Manasseh's head.
Verse_Ch: 48:18 约瑟对他父亲说，我父，不是这样。这个才是长子，求你把右手按在他的头上。 ###EN### And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.
Verse_Ch: 48:19 他父亲不肯，说，我知道，我儿，我知道。他也必成为一族，也必昌大。只是他的弟弟将来比他还大；他弟弟的后裔必成为多族。 ###EN### But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will become
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations.
Verse_Ch: 48:20 当日以色列给他们祝福说，以色列人必指着你们祝福说，愿神使你如以法莲、玛拿西一样。于是立以法莲在玛拿西之前。 ###EN### And he blessed them that day, saying, By you Israel will bless, saying, God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh. Thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Verse_Ch: 48:21 以色列又对约瑟说，看哪，我快要死了，但神必与你们同在，领你们回到你们列祖之地。 ###EN### And Israel said to Joseph, Now I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.
