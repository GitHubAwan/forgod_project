Verse_Ch: 1:4 也不可注意虚构无稽之事，和无穷的家谱；这等事只引起辩论，对于神在信仰里的经纶并无助益。 ###EN### Nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God's economy, which is in faith.
Verse_Ch: 1:5 这嘱咐的目的乃是爱，这爱是出于清洁的心、无亏的良心、并无伪的信心。 ###EN### But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith;

Verse_Ch: 2:6 祂舍了自己，为万人作赎价，在适当的时期，这事就证明出来； ###EN### Who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony to be borne in its own times.

Chapter_Header: 3
Verse_Ch: 3:1 人若渴望得监督的职分，就是羡慕善工；这话是可信的。 ###EN### Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work.
Verse_Ch: 3:2 所以作监督的必须无可指责，只作一个妻子的丈夫，节制适度，清明自守，端正规矩，乐意待客，善于教导； ###EN### The overseer then must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach;

Verse_Ch: 3:16 并且，大哉！敬虔的奥秘！这是众所公认的，就是：祂显现于肉体，被称义于灵里，被天使看见，被传于万邦，被信仰于世人中，被接去于荣耀里。 ###EN### And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.
Chapter_Header: 4
Verse_Ch: 4:1 但那灵明说，在后来的时期，必有人离弃信仰，去注意迷惑人的灵和鬼的教训； ###EN### But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons
Verse_Ch: 4:2 这乃是借着说谎之人的假冒，他们自己的良心犹如给热铁烙过； ###EN### By means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, of men who are branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron,
Verse_Ch: 4:3 他们禁止嫁娶，禁戒食物，就是神所造，给那些信的人，并认识真理的人，感谢着享受的。 ###EN### Who forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth.
