Verse_Ch: 1:1 当士师秉政的时候，以色列地遭遇饥荒。有一个人带着妻子和两个儿子，从犹大的伯利恒往摩押乡间去寄居。 ###EN### Now in the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a man from Bethlehem in Judah went down to dwell as a sojourner in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
Verse_Ch: 1:2 这人名叫以利米勒，他妻子名叫拿俄米；他两个儿子，一个名叫玛伦，一个名叫基连，都是犹大伯利恒的以法他人。他们到了摩押乡间，就住在那里。 ###EN### And the man's name was Elimelech, and his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there.
Verse_Ch: 1:3 后来拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒死了，剩下妇人和她两个儿子。 ###EN### And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.
Verse_Ch: 1:4 这两个儿子娶了摩押女子为妻，一个名叫俄珥巴，一个名叫路得，在那里住了约有十年。 ###EN### And they took wives for themselves from among the Moabite women. One's name was Orpah, and the second's name was Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.
Verse_Ch: 1:5 玛伦和基连二人也死了，剩下妇人拿俄米，两个孩子没有了，丈夫也没有了。 ###EN### And both Mahlon and Chilion died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband.
Verse_Ch: 1:6 她就与两个儿媳起身，要从摩押乡间归回；因为她在摩押乡间听见耶和华眷顾祂的百姓，赐粮食与他们。 ###EN### Then she rose up with her daughters-in-law in order to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them food.
Verse_Ch: 1:7 于是她带同两个儿媳，起行离开所在的地方，上路回犹大地去。 ###EN### So she went forth from the place where she had been, along with her two daughters-in-law; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
Verse_Ch: 1:8 拿俄米对两个儿媳说，你们各人回娘家去罢。愿耶和华以恩慈待你们，像你们以恩慈待已死的人与我一样。 ###EN### And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go and return, each of you, to your mother's house. May Jehovah deal kindly with you, just as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
Verse_Ch: 1:9 愿耶和华使你们各在新夫家中寻得安息。于是拿俄米与她们亲嘴，她们就放声而哭， ###EN### May Jehovah grant you to find rest, each of you in the house of your husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept.
Verse_Ch: 1:10 说，不然，我们必与你一同回你本民那里去。 ###EN### And they said to her, No, we will return with you to your people.
Verse_Ch: 1:11 拿俄米说，我女儿们哪，回去罢。为何要跟我去呢？我腹中还有儿子可以作你们的丈夫么？ ###EN### And Naomi said, Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Verse_Ch: 1:12 我女儿们哪，回去罢；我年纪老迈，不能再有丈夫。即或我说，我还有指望，今夜有丈夫可以生子， ###EN### Return, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I said, I have hope; even if I had a husband tonight and even bore sons;
Verse_Ch: 1:13 你们岂能等着他们长大呢？你们岂能为他们守身不嫁人呢？我女儿们哪，不要这样。我比你们更是愁苦，因为耶和华伸手攻击我。 ###EN### Would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having a husband? No, my daughters; it has been far more bitter for me than it should be for you, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me.
Verse_Ch: 1:14 两个儿媳又放声而哭；俄珥巴与婆婆亲嘴而别，只是路得紧紧随着婆婆。 ###EN### And they lifted up their voice and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother- in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
Verse_Ch: 1:15 拿俄米说，看哪，你嫂子已经回她本民和她的神那里去了，你也跟着你嫂子回去罢。 ###EN### And she said, Your sister-in-law has now returned to her people and to her gods; return with your sister-in-law.
Verse_Ch: 1:16 路得说，不要催我离开你回去不跟随你。你往那里去，我也往那里去；你在那里住宿，我也在那里住宿；你的民就是我的民，你的神就是我的神。 ###EN### But Ruth said, Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.
Verse_Ch: 1:17 你在那里死，我也在那里死，也葬在那里。除非死能使你我相离，不然，愿耶和华重重的降罚与我。 ###EN### Where you die, I will die; and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more as well, if anything but death parts me from you.
Verse_Ch: 1:18 拿俄米见路得定意要跟随自己去，就不再对她说什么了。 ###EN### And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she ceased speaking to her about it.
Verse_Ch: 1:19 于是二人同行，来到伯利恒。她们到了伯利恒，合城的人就都因她们惊动；妇女们说，这不是拿俄米么？ ###EN### So the two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them; and the women said, Is this Naomi?
Verse_Ch: 1:20 拿俄米对她们说，不要叫我拿俄米，要叫我玛拉，因为全足者使我受了大苦。 ###EN### And she said to them, Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara; for the All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me.
Verse_Ch: 1:21 我满满的出去，耶和华使我空空的回来。耶和华使我受苦，全足者以祸患待我。既是这样，你们为何还叫我拿俄米呢？ ###EN### I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, when Jehovah has afflicted me and the All-sufficient One has dealt harshly with me?
Verse_Ch: 1:22 拿俄米和她儿媳摩押女子路得，从摩押乡间回来；她们到了伯利恒，正是动手割大麦的时候。 ###EN### So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
Chapter_Header: 2
Verse_Ch: 2:1 拿俄米在她丈夫以利米勒的家族中，有一个相识的人，是个大财主，名叫波阿斯。 ###EN### Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a man of great wealth, from Elimelech's family; and his name was Boaz.
Verse_Ch: 2:2 摩押女子路得对拿俄米说，请你让我往田间去，我在谁的眼中蒙恩，就在谁的身后拾取麦穗。拿俄米说，女儿阿，你只管去。 ###EN### And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
Verse_Ch: 2:3 路得就去了。她来到田间，在收割的人身后拾取麦穗，恰巧是在以利米勒家族的人波阿斯那块田里。 ###EN### So she went. And she came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to glean in a portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's family.
Verse_Ch: 2:4 波阿斯正从伯利恒来，对收割的人说，愿耶和华与你们同在。他们回答说，愿耶和华赐福与你。 ###EN### And just then Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they said to him, Jehovah bless you.
Verse_Ch: 2:5 波阿斯对监管收割之人的仆人说，那是谁家的女子？ ###EN### And Boaz said to his young man who was set over the reapers, Whose young woman is that?
Verse_Ch: 2:6 监管收割之人的仆人回答说，是那摩押女子，随同拿俄米从摩押乡间回来的。 ###EN### And the young man who was set over the reapers answered and said, She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the country of Moab;
Verse_Ch: 2:7 她说，请你让我在收割的人身后，拾取打捆剩下的麦穗。她早晨就来了，直到如今，除了在屋子里坐一会儿，一直留在这里。 ###EN### And she said, Let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she has come and continued since morning until now, and she has sat in the house for only a little while.
Verse_Ch: 2:8 波阿斯对路得说，女儿阿，听我说，不要往别人田里拾取麦穗，也不要离开这里，要紧随着我的使女们。 ###EN### And Boaz said to Ruth, Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field, and also do not pass from here but stay close to my young women.
Verse_Ch: 2:9 你要留意她们在那块田收割，你就跟着她们去。我已经吩咐仆人不可触犯你；你若渴了，就可以到器皿那里喝仆人打来的水。 ###EN### Keep your eyes on the field that they reap; follow after them. I have charged my young men not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, you shall go to the vessels and drink of what the young men have drawn.
Verse_Ch: 2:10 路得就面伏于地叩拜，对他说，我既是外邦人，怎么在你眼中蒙恩，使你这样顾恤我呢？ ###EN### And she fell upon her face and bowed herself to the ground, and she said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight that you regard me, though I am a foreigner?
Verse_Ch: 2:11 波阿斯回答说，自从你丈夫死后，凡你向婆婆所行的，并你离开父母和出生地，到素不认识的民中，这一切事人全都告诉我了。 ###EN### And Boaz answered and said to her, All that you have done for your mother- in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me, as well as how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people whom you did not know before.
Verse_Ch: 2:12 愿耶和华照你所行的报答你；你来投靠耶和华以色列神的翅膀下，愿你满得祂的酬报。 ###EN### May Jehovah recompense your work, and may you have a full reward from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.
Verse_Ch: 2:13 路得说，我主阿，愿我在你眼前蒙恩；我虽然不及你的一个婢女，你还安慰我，亲切的与你的婢女说话。 ###EN### And she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your servant girl, though I am not like even one of your servant girls.
Verse_Ch: 2:14 到了吃饭的时候，波阿斯对路得说，你到这里来吃点饼，将饼蘸在醋里。路得就在收割的人旁边坐下；波阿斯把烘了的穗子递给她。她吃饱了，还有 余剩的。 ###EN### And Boaz said to her at mealtime, Come here and eat some food; and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and he extended some parched grain to her. And she ate and was satisfied, and she had some left.
Verse_Ch: 2:15 她起来又拾取麦穗，波阿斯吩咐仆人说，她就是在禾捆中拾取麦穗，也可以容她，不可羞辱她； ###EN### And when she rose up to glean, Boaz charged his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the standing grain, and do not reproach her.
Verse_Ch: 2:16 并要从捆里抽出些来，留给她拾取，不可斥责她。 ###EN### And also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her to glean; and do not rebuke her.
Verse_Ch: 2:17 这样，路得在田间拾取麦穗，直到晚上；将所拾取的打了，约有一伊法大麦。 ###EN### So she gleaned in the field until evening. And she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
Verse_Ch: 2:18 她就把所拾取的带进城去给婆婆看，又把她吃饱了所剩的拿出来给婆婆。 ###EN### And she took it up and went into the city. And her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Ruth also brought out and gave to her what she had left after she had been earlier satisfied.
Verse_Ch: 2:19 婆婆对她说，你今日在那里拾取麦穗，在那里作工呢？愿那顾恤你的蒙福。路得就告诉婆婆她在谁那里作工，说，我今日在一个名叫波阿斯的人那里 作工。 ###EN### And her mother-in-law said to her, Where did you glean today, and where did you work? Blessed be he who paid such attention to you. And she told her mother- in-law whom she had worked with and said, The name of the man whom I worked with today is Boaz.
Verse_Ch: 2:20 拿俄米对儿媳说，愿那人蒙耶和华赐福，因为他不断以慈爱待活人和死人。拿俄米又说，那人与我们相近，是我们的亲人。 ###EN### And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, whose lovingkindness has not failed for the living and for the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is close to us; he is one of our kinsmen.
Verse_Ch: 2:21 摩押女子路得说，他也对我说，你要紧随我的仆人拾取麦穗，直等他们收完了我的庄稼。 ###EN### And Ruth the Moabitess said, He also said to me, You shall stay close by my young men who are with me until they have completed the whole harvest that I have.
Verse_Ch: 2:22 拿俄米对儿媳路得说，女儿阿，你跟着他的使女出去，不叫人遇见你在别人田间，这才为好。 ###EN### And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that others do not meet you in any other field.
Verse_Ch: 2:23 于是路得紧随波阿斯的使女拾取麦穗，直到收完了大麦和小麦；路得仍与婆婆同住。 ###EN### So she stayed close to Boaz's young women and gleaned until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest, and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
Chapter_Header: 3
Verse_Ch: 3:1 路得的婆婆拿俄米对她说，女儿阿，我不当为你找个安身之处，使你享福么？ ###EN### And Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, My daughter, I must seek some resting place for you, that it may go well with you.
Verse_Ch: 3:2 你与波阿斯的使女常在一处，波阿斯不是我们相识的人么？看哪，他今夜在禾场上簸大麦。 ###EN### And now is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you have been? Behold, he is winnowing the barley tonight at the threshing floor.
Verse_Ch: 3:3 你要沐浴抹膏，换上衣服，下到禾场上，却不要使那人认出你来，直等他吃喝完了。 ###EN### Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes; and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
Verse_Ch: 3:4 到他躺下的时候，你看准他躺卧的地方，就进去掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里；他必告诉你所当作的事。 ###EN### And when he lies down, notice the place where he lies, and go and uncover his feet, and lie down. And he will tell you what you should do.
Verse_Ch: 3:5 路得说，凡你所说的，我必遵行。 ###EN### And she said to her, All that you say, I will do.

Verse_Ch: 3:7 波阿斯吃喝完了，心里欢畅，就到麦堆尽边去躺下。路得便悄悄的来掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里。 ###EN### And Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry. And he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. And she came in secretly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
Verse_Ch: 3:8 到了夜半，那人忽然惊醒，翻过身来，不料有女子躺在他的脚边。 ###EN### Then at midnight the man was startled; and he turned over, and a woman was there, lying at his feet.
Verse_Ch: 3:9 他就说，你是谁？她回答说，我是你的婢女路得。请你展开你的衣边遮盖你的婢女，因为你是我的亲人。 ###EN### And he said, Who are you? And she said, I am Ruth, your female servant. Spread your cloak over your female servant, for you are a kinsman.
Verse_Ch: 3:10 波阿斯说，女儿阿，愿你蒙耶和华赐福。你末后所显出的恩慈比先前的更美；因为少年人无论贫富，你都没有跟从。 ###EN### And he said, Blessed be you of Jehovah, my daughter. You have shown your latter kindness to be better than your first by not going after the choice young men, whether poor or rich.
Verse_Ch: 3:11 女儿阿，现在不要惧怕；凡你所说的，我必为你行，因我本城的人都知道你是个贤德的女子。 ###EN### And now, my daughter, do not fear. All that you say, I will do for you; for all the assembly of my people know that you are a worthy woman.
Verse_Ch: 3:12 我实在是你的亲人，只是还有一个亲人比我更近。 ###EN### And now it is true that I am a kinsman, yet there is a kinsman closer than I.
Verse_Ch: 3:13 你今夜在这里住宿，明早他若肯为你尽亲人的本分，就由他尽好了。倘若不肯，我指着永活的耶和华起誓，我必为你尽亲人的本分，你只管躺到黎明。 ###EN### Stay for the night; and in the morning if he will do the kinsman's duty, fine; let him do it. But if he is not willing to do the kinsman's duty for you, I will do it for you, as Jehovah lives. Lie down until morning.
Verse_Ch: 3:14 路得便在他脚边躺到黎明，人彼此还不能辨认的时候就起来了；因为波阿斯说，不可使人知道有女子到禾场上来。 ###EN### And she lay at his feet until morning, then rose up before one could recognize another; for he said, Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.
Verse_Ch: 3:15 他又说，把你所披的外衣拿来打开。她打开了，波阿斯就量了六簸箕大麦，放在她肩上，他便进城去了。 ###EN### And he said, Bring the cloak that is on you, and hold it open. And she held it open, and he measured out six measures of barley and laid it on her. And he went into the city.
Verse_Ch: 3:16 路得回到婆婆那里，婆婆说，女儿阿，怎么样了？路得就将那人为她所行的一切都告诉婆婆， ###EN### And when she came to her mother- in-law, she said, How are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done for her.

Chapter_Header: 4
Verse_Ch: 4:1 波阿斯上城门去，坐在那里，恰巧波阿斯所说的那亲人经过。波阿斯说，某人哪，你转过来坐在这里。他就转过来坐下。 ###EN### Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat there. And just then the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came by. And Boaz said, Turn aside and sit here, friend. And he turned aside and sat down.
Verse_Ch: 4:2 波阿斯又从本城的长老中选取了十个人，对他们说，请你们坐在这里。他们就都坐下。 ###EN### And he took ten men from among the elders of the city and said, Sit here. And they sat down.
Verse_Ch: 4:3 波阿斯对那亲人说，从摩押乡间回来的拿俄米，现在要卖我们弟兄以利米勒的那块田地； ###EN### And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, has put up for sale the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
Verse_Ch: 4:4 我想我应当向你表明，说，你可以在这里坐着的人面前和我族人的长老面前买这块田地。你若肯赎就赎，若不肯赎就告诉我，让我知道；因为只有你 可以赎，其次就是我。那人回答说，我肯赎。 ###EN### So I thought that I should disclose this to you and say, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you can redeem it, redeem it; but if you cannot redeem it, tell me so that I will know; for there is no one to redeem it ahead of you, and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.
Verse_Ch: 4:5 波阿斯说，你从拿俄米手中买这田地的时候，也当娶死人的妻摩押女子路得，叫死人的名得以在他的产业上存立。 ###EN### Then Boaz said, On the day you buy the field from Naomi's hand, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead man, in order to raise up the dead man's name upon his inheritance.
Verse_Ch: 4:6 那亲人说，这样我自己就不能赎了，恐怕于我的产业有损。你自己可以赎我所当赎的，因我不能赎了。 ###EN### And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, or else I will mar my own inheritance. You redeem for yourself what I should redeem, for I cannot redeem it.
Verse_Ch: 4:7 从前，在以色列中要确立什么事，或赎回，或交易，这人就脱鞋给那人。以色列中乃是以此为证据。 ###EN### Now such was the custom formerly in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging that to establish any matter a man would draw off his sandal and give it to his neighbor; this was the way of attesting it in Israel.
Verse_Ch: 4:8 那亲人对波阿斯说，你自己买罢；于是将鞋脱下来了。 ###EN### So when the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself, he drew off his sandal.
Verse_Ch: 4:9 波阿斯对长老和众民说，你们今日作见证，凡属以利米勒和基连、玛伦的，我都从拿俄米手中置买了； ###EN### And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, You are witnesses today, that I buy from Naomi's hand all that was Elimelech's and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's.
Verse_Ch: 4:10 我又娶了玛伦的妻摩押女子路得为妻，好叫死人的名得以在他的产业上存立，免得死人的名从他的弟兄中，并从他本乡灭没。你们今日可以作见证。 ###EN### Furthermore Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I acquire as my own wife so that I may raise up the dead man's name upon his inheritance and the dead man's name may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.
Verse_Ch: 4:11 在城门坐着的众民和长老都说，我们作见证。愿耶和华使进你家的这女子，像建立以色列家的拉结、利亚二人一样。又愿你在以法他得财富，在伯利 恒得名声。 ###EN### And all the people who were in the gate and the elders said, We are witnesses. May Jehovah make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, the two who built the house of Israel. And prosper in Ephrathah, and gain a name in Bethlehem.
Verse_Ch: 4:12 愿耶和华从这少年女子赐你后裔，使你的家像他玛从犹大所生法勒斯的家一般。 ###EN### And may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the seed that Jehovah gives you by this young woman.
Verse_Ch: 4:13 于是，波阿斯娶了路得为妻，与她同房。耶和华使她怀孕，她就生了一个儿子。 ###EN### So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah made her conceive; and she bore a son.
Verse_Ch: 4:14 妇人们对拿俄米说，耶和华是当受颂赞的，祂今日没有撇下你使你无亲人；愿这孩子在以色列中得名声。 ###EN### And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who has not left you today without a kinsman; and may his name be famous in Israel.
Verse_Ch: 4:15 他必使你的精神复苏，并且奉养你的老，因为他是那爱你的儿媳所生的；有这儿媳比有七个儿子还好。 ###EN### And he will be to you as a restorer of life and a sustainer in your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.
Verse_Ch: 4:16 拿俄米就把孩子抱在怀中，作他的养母。 ###EN### And Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and she became his nurse.
Verse_Ch: 4:17 邻舍的妇人给孩子起名，说，拿俄米得儿子了；就给他起名叫俄备得。这俄备得是耶西的父，耶西是大卫的父。 ###EN### And the women neighbors gave him a name, saying, A son has been born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
Verse_Ch: 4:18 法勒斯的后代记在下面：法勒斯生希斯仑， ###EN### Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron,
