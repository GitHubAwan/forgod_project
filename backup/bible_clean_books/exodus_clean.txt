Verse_Ch: 1:9 他对他的民说，看哪，这以色列民比我们多，又比我们强盛。 ###EN### And he said to his people, The people of the children of Israel are now more numerous and stronger than we.
Verse_Ch: 1:10 来罢，我们不如用巧计待他们，免得他们多起来，日后若发生战事，就联合我们的仇敌攻击我们，离开这地上去了。 ###EN### Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and, when some war occurs, they also join themselves to those who hate us and fight against us and go up

Verse_Ch: 1:18 埃及王召了接生妇来，说，你们为什么作这事，让男孩存活？ ###EN### So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing and let the male children live?
Verse_Ch: 1:19 接生妇对法老说，因为希伯来妇人与埃及妇人不同；希伯来妇人本是健壮的，接生妇还没有到，她们已经生产了。 ###EN### And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous: before the midwife comes to them, they

Verse_Ch: 2:3 后来不能再藏，就取了一个蒲草箱，抹上石漆和柏油，将孩子放在里面，把箱子搁在河边的芦苇中。 ###EN### And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him a papyrus basket and plastered it with tar and pitch; and she put the child in it and placed it among the

Verse_Ch: 2:14 那人说，谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢？难道你想要杀我，像杀那埃及人么？摩西便惧怕，说，这事必是被人知道了。 ###EN### And he said, Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you thinking to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses became frightened and said,
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: Surely the matter is known.
Verse_Ch: 2:15 法老听见这事，就想要杀摩西；但摩西逃避法老，去米甸地居住。 ###EN### Now when Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh to dwell in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
Verse_Ch: 2:16 一日，他在井旁坐下。米甸的祭司有七个女儿；她们来打水，打满了槽，要给父亲的群羊喝水。 ###EN### Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: power and with a mighty hand?
Verse_Ch: 32:12 为什么使埃及人议论说，祂领他们出去，是要降祸与他们，把他们杀在山中，将他们从地面上除灭？求你转意，不发你的烈怒，后悔，不降祸与你的百姓。 ###EN### Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, With evil intent He brought them out, to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth?
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: Turn from Your burning anger, and repent of this evil against Your people.

Verse_Ch: 32:23 他们对我说，你为我们造神像，可以在我们前面引路；因为领我们从埃及地上来的那人摩西，我们不知道他遭遇了什么事。 ###EN### For they said to me, Make gods for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has
UNCLASSIFIED_GENERAL: become of him.
Verse_Ch: 32:24 所以我对他们说，凡有金环的，可以摘下来，他们就给了我。我把金环扔在火中，这牛犊便出来了。 ###EN### So I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.
Verse_Ch: 32:25 摩西见百姓放肆，(因为亚伦纵容他们，使他们在仇敌中间被讥刺，) ###EN### And when Moses saw that the people were without restraint (for Aaron had let them be without restraint to be a derision among those who rise up against them),
