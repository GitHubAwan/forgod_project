Verse_Ch: 16:2 主人叫管家来，对他说，我所听到关于你的事，是怎么样？把你管家职分的账目交代清楚，因你不能再作管家了。 ###EN### And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.
Verse_Ch: 16:3 那管家心里说，主人要撤去我的管家职分，我该作什么才好？锄地吧，无力；讨饭吧，怕羞。 ###EN### And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.

Verse_Ch: 16:26 不但这样，在我们与你们之间还有深渊隔定，以致人想要从这边过到你们那边是不能的，从那边越过来到我们这边也是不能的。 ###EN### And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over.
Verse_Ch: 16:27 财主说，我祖阿，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去， ###EN### And he said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father --

Verse_Ch: 17:2 就是把磨石套在这人的脖子上，丢在海里，还强如他把这小子里的一个绊跌了。 ###EN### It is more profitable for him if a millstone is put around his neck and he is hurled into the sea than to stumble one of these little ones.

Verse_Ch: 17:9 奴仆照所吩咐的去作，主人还谢谢他么？ ###EN### He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he?
Verse_Ch: 17:10 你们也是如此，作完了一切吩咐你们的事，只当说，我们是无用的奴仆，所作的本是我们应当作的。 ###EN### So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.

Verse_Ch: 18:2 某城里有一个审判官，不惧怕神，也不尊重人。 ###EN### Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city who did not fear God and did not regard man.

Verse_Ch: 18:15 有人把婴孩也带到耶稣那里，要祂摸他们，门徒看见，就责备那些人。 ###EN### And they were bringing to Him also their babies that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw this they rebuked them.

Verse_Ch: 18:26 听见的人说，这样谁能得救？ ###EN### And those who heard said, Then who can be saved?
Verse_Ch: 18:27 耶稣说，在人所不能的事，在神却能。 ###EN### But He said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.
Verse_Ch: 18:28 彼得说，看哪，我们已经撇下自己所有的，跟从了你。 ###EN### And Peter said, Behold, we have left our own things and have followed You.
Verse_Ch: 18:29 耶稣说，我实在告诉你们，人为神的国，撇下房屋、或是妻子、弟兄、父母、儿女， ###EN### And He said to them, Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,
Verse_Ch: 18:30 没有不在今世得许多倍，且要在来世得永远生命的。 ###EN### Who shall not by all means receive back many times as much in this time, and in the coming age, eternal life.
Verse_Ch: 18:31 耶稣把十二个门徒带到一边，对他们说，看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，那借着申言者所写一切关于人子的事，都要成就。 ###EN### And taking the twelve aside, He said to them, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which have been written through the prophets regarding the Son of Man will be accomplished,
Verse_Ch: 18:32 祂将要被交给外邦人，受戏弄，受凌辱，受吐唾， ###EN### For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles and will be mocked and outrageously treated and spat upon;
Verse_Ch: 18:33 并被他们鞭打，杀害，第三日祂必复活。 ###EN### And when they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.
Verse_Ch: 18:34 这些事门徒一样也不领悟，这话对他们是隐藏的，所说的事，他们都不晓得。 ###EN### And they understood none of these things, and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said.
Verse_Ch: 18:35 耶稣将近耶利哥的时候，有一个瞎子坐在路旁讨饭。 ###EN### And as He drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the road, begging.

Verse_Ch: 19:3 他想要看看耶稣是谁，只因人多，他的身量又矮，所以不能看见。 ###EN### And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He was, and could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.
Verse_Ch: 19:4 于是先跑到前头，爬上一棵桑树，要看耶稣，因为耶稣就要从那里经过。 ###EN### And he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.
