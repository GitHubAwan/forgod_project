Verse_Ch: 2:1 我心里说，来罢，我要试一试享乐，好享美福！谁知，这也是虚空。 ###EN### I said in my heart, Come now, I will test out pleasure; so taste enjoyment. But indeed, this also is vanity.

Verse_Ch: 2:11 后来，我转看我手所作的一切工，和我工作中的劳碌；谁知都是虚空，都是捕风；在日光之下毫无益处。 ###EN### Then I turned to all the works that my hands had done and the labor by which I had labored in doing them, and indeed, all was vanity and a chasing after wind; and there was no advantage under the sun.
Verse_Ch: 2:12 我转看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。在王以后来的人还能作什么呢？也不过作早先所作的就是了。 ###EN### And I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly, for what will the man do who comes after the king? Only that which has been done already.
Verse_Ch: 2:13 我便看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗。 ###EN### And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.
Verse_Ch: 2:14 智慧人的眼目光明，愚昧人在黑暗里行；但我也看明，这两等人所遭遇的都是一样。 ###EN### The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness; yet I also perceived that one fate happens to them all.
Verse_Ch: 2:15 我就心里说，愚昧人所遭遇的，我也必遭遇。既是这样，我为何更有智慧呢？我心里说，这也是虚空。 ###EN### And I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so also will it happen to me. Why then have I been so wise? And I said in my heart, This also is vanity.
Verse_Ch: 2:16 智慧人和愚昧人一样，永远无人记念，因为日后都要被遗忘；可叹智慧人死亡，与愚昧人无异！ ###EN### For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance forever, seeing that in the days to come all will be forgotten. And how the wise man dies just like the fool!
Verse_Ch: 2:17 所以我恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所作的工，我都以为烦恼；一切都是虚空，都是捕风。 ###EN### So I hated life, for the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me, because everything is vanity and a chasing after wind.
Verse_Ch: 2:18 我恨恶一切的劳碌，就是我在日光之下的劳碌，因为我所得的都必留给我以后的人。 ###EN### And I hated all my labor for which I had labored under the sun, because I will leave it to the man who comes after me.
Verse_Ch: 2:19 那人是智慧是愚昧，谁能知道？他竟要管理我劳碌所得的一切，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。这也是虚空。 ###EN### And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will be master over all my labor for which I have labored and in which I exercised wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
Verse_Ch: 2:20 故此，我转想我在日光之下劳碌所得的一切，心便绝望。 ###EN### Therefore I turned and gave my heart up to despair of all the labor for which I had labored under the sun;
Verse_Ch: 2:21 因为有人用智慧、知识、技能所劳碌得来的，却要留给未曾劳碌的人为分。这也是虚空，也是大患。 ###EN### For there is a man whose labor has been with wisdom and with knowledge and with skill, and to a man who has not labored on it he gives it as his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
Verse_Ch: 2:22 人在日光之下劳碌操心，在他一切的劳碌上得着什么呢？ ###EN### For what will a man have with all his labor and with the striving of his heart by which he labors under the sun?
Verse_Ch: 2:23 因为他一生的日子都是忧伤，他的辛劳成为愁烦，连夜间心也不安息。这也是虚空。 ###EN### For all his days are sorrow, and his travail is vexation; even at night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.
Verse_Ch: 2:24 人莫强如吃喝，且让自己在劳碌中享美福。我看这也是出于神的手。 ###EN### There is nothing better for man than to eat and to drink and to make his soul taste enjoyment in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
Verse_Ch: 2:25 因为离了祂，谁能吃用、享受呢？ ###EN### For who can eat or who can enjoy without Him?
Verse_Ch: 2:26 神看谁为好，就给谁智慧、知识和喜乐；却将辛劳给罪人，叫他将所收聚的、所堆积的，归给神看为好的人。这也是虚空，也是捕风。 ###EN### For to the man who is good in His sight He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He gives the travail of gathering and heaping up that it may be given to him who is good in God's sight. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.

Verse_Ch: 3:10 我见神将辛劳给世人，使他们在其中操劳。 ###EN### I have seen the travail that God has given the children of men to travail in.
Verse_Ch: 3:11 神造万物，各按其时成为美好，又将永远安置在世人心里。虽是这样，人并不能参透神从始至终的作为。 ###EN### He has made everything beautiful in its own time; also He has put eternity in their heart, yet so that man does not find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
Verse_Ch: 3:12 我知道人莫强如一生喜乐行善； ###EN### I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and do good in their lifetime;

Verse_Ch: 3:14 我知道神一切所作的都必永存；无可增添，无可减少。神这样行，是要人在祂面前敬畏祂。 ###EN### I know that whatever God does, it will be forever; nothing can be added to it, nor can anything be taken from it. God has so done, that all would fear Him.
Verse_Ch: 3:15 现今的事早先就有了，将来的事早已也有了，并且神使已过的事重新再来。 ###EN### That which is has already been, and that which will be has already been; and God seeks what has passed.
Verse_Ch: 3:16 我又见日光之下，在审判之处有奸恶，在公义之处也有奸恶。 ###EN### Moreover I saw under the sun that in the place of judgment, wickedness is there; and in the place of righteousness, wickedness is there.
Verse_Ch: 3:17 我心里说，神必审判义人和恶人；因为在那里，各样事务，各样工作，都有定时。 ###EN### I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and every work.
Verse_Ch: 3:18 我心里说，这乃为世人的缘故，是神要试验他们，使他们看见自己不过像兽一样。 ###EN### I said in my heart, This is so for the sake of the children of men, that God may prove them and that they may see for themselves that they are but beasts.
Verse_Ch: 3:19 因为世人遭遇的，兽也遭遇，二者所遭遇的都是一样：这个怎样死，那个也怎样死，气息都是一样。人并不强于兽；因为都是虚空。 ###EN### For what happens to the children of men happens also to beasts; even the same thing happens to them both: As the one dies, so dies the other; and they all have one breath; and man has no advantage over the beast; for all is vanity.

Verse_Ch: 3:21 谁知道世人的气是往上升，兽的气是下入地呢？ ###EN### Who knows the breath of the children of men, that it goes upward; or the breath of the beasts, that it goes downward to the earth?
Verse_Ch: 3:22 故此，我见人莫强如在他所作的事上快乐，因为这是他的分。他身后的事，谁会领他来看呢？ ###EN### Therefore I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion. For who will bring him to see what will be after him?

Verse_Ch: 4:1 我又见日光之下所行的一切欺压。看哪，受欺压的流泪，无人安慰；欺压他们的有势力，也无人安慰他们。 ###EN### Then again I saw all the acts of oppression that are done under the sun; and indeed, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of the oppressors was power, and they had no comforter.
Verse_Ch: 4:2 因此，我赞叹那早已死的死人，胜过那还活着的活人。 ###EN### And I praised the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive.
Verse_Ch: 4:3 并且我以为那未曾生的，就是未见过日光之下恶事的，比这两等人更好。 ###EN### And better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
Verse_Ch: 4:4 我又见人一切的劳碌，和工作上各样的技能，被邻舍所嫉妒。这也是虚空，也是捕风。 ###EN### Then I saw all labor and all skill in work, that it is man's jealousy for his neighbor. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.

Yet there is no end to all his labor; moreover his eye is not satisfied with riches. For whom then, he says, do I labor and deprive myself of good? This also is vanity and grievous travail.
Verse_Ch: 4:9 两个人总比一个人好，因为二人劳碌，可得美好的酬报； ###EN### Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor;
Verse_Ch: 4:10 若是跌倒，一人可以扶起他的同伴。若是孤身跌倒，没有别人扶他起来，这人就有祸了！ ###EN### For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls and does not have another to lift him up!
Verse_Ch: 4:11 再者，二人同睡就都暖和，一人独睡怎能暖和呢？ ###EN### Again, if two lie together, they keep warm. But how can one be warm alone?
Verse_Ch: 4:12 有人能打胜孤身一人，若有二人便能抵挡他；三股合成的绳子，不容易折断。 ###EN### And while a man may prevail against the one, the two will withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

Verse_Ch: 5:1 你到神的殿要谨慎脚步；近前聆听，胜过愚昧人献祭；因为他们不知道所作的是恶。 ###EN### Guard your steps when you go to the house of God, and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know that they are doing evil.
Verse_Ch: 5:2 你在神面前不可冒失开口，也不可心急发言；因为神在天上，你在地上，所以你的言语要寡少。 ###EN### Do not be rash with your mouth, and let not your heart hastily utter anything before God; for God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.

Verse_Ch: 5:14 因生意不顺，这些财富就丧失；那人若生了儿子，手里也一无所有。 ###EN### And those riches were lost in a bad venture; and having begotten a son, he had nothing in his hand.
Verse_Ch: 5:15 他怎样出母腹赤身而来，也必照样赤身而去；他所劳碌得来的，手中分毫不能带去。 ###EN### As he came forth from his mother's womb, he will return naked as he came; and he will take nothing of his labor that he may carry in his hand.
Verse_Ch: 5:16 他来的情形怎样，他去的情形也怎样，这也是一大祸患；他为风劳碌有什么益处呢？ ###EN### And this also is a grievous evil: in all points, as he came, so will he go; so what is the advantage to him who has labored for the wind?
Verse_Ch: 5:17 他终身在黑暗中吃喝，多有烦恼、病痛、愤怨。 ###EN### Throughout all his days he also eats in darkness and has much vexation and sickness and resentment.

Chapter_Header: 6
Verse_Ch: 6:1 我见日光之下有一祸患，重压在人身上， ###EN### There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon man:
Verse_Ch: 6:2 就是人蒙神赐他赀财、丰富、尊荣，以致他心里所愿的一样都不缺，只是神使他不能吃用，反有外人来吃用。这是虚空，也是大祸患。 ###EN### A man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that nothing is lacking to his soul of all that he desires, and yet God does not empower him to eat of it, but a stranger eats it. This is vanity and an evil plague.
Verse_Ch: 6:3 人若生一百个儿女，活许多岁数，以致他的年日甚多，心里却不得满享福乐，又不得安葬；我就说，那不到期而落的胎比他倒好； ###EN### If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good and even does not get a proper burial, I say that the stillborn is better off than he;

Verse_Ch: 7:14 遇亨通的日子，你当喜乐；遭患难的日子，你当思想；神造了这样，也造了那样，为叫人查不出身后有什么事。 ###EN### In the day of prosperity be joyful, And in the day of adversity consider. God has made the one as well as the other, So that man may not find out anything about what is after him.
Verse_Ch: 7:15 我在虚度的日子中见过一切的事：有义人在自己的义中灭亡；有恶人在自己的恶中享长寿。 ###EN### I have seen everything in my days of vanity: There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.

Verse_Ch: 7:28 我心仍在寻找，却未寻到。在一千人中，我寻到一个正直人，但在这些人中，却寻不到一个妇人。 ###EN### Which my soul is still seeking but has not found. One man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all these I have not found.
Verse_Ch: 7:29 看哪，我所找到的只有一件，就是神将人造得正直，但他们却寻出许多巧计。 ###EN### See, this alone have I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.
Chapter_Header: 8
Verse_Ch: 8:1 谁如智慧人呢？谁知道事情的解释呢？人的智慧使他的脸发光，并使他脸上的戾气改变。 ###EN### Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the sternness of his face is changed.

Verse_Ch: 8:10 然后我见恶人得以埋葬，他们生前进入并离开圣处，却在他们这样行的城中被人忘记。这也是虚空。 ###EN### And then I saw the wicked buried, who before had gone in and come forth from the holy place and were forgotten in the city where they had thus acted. This also is vanity.
Verse_Ch: 8:11 因为对恶事的判决不立刻执行，所以世人满心作恶。 ###EN### Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set within them to do evil.
Verse_Ch: 8:12 罪人虽然作恶百次，倒享长寿；然而我也知道，敬畏神的，就是在祂面前敬畏的人，终久必得福乐。 ###EN### Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will be well with the God- fearing who are in fear before Him;
Verse_Ch: 8:13 恶人却不得福乐，也不得享长寿；他的日子好像影儿，因他在神面前不存敬畏。 ###EN### But it will not be well with the wicked man, nor will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he is not in fear before God.
Verse_Ch: 8:14 地上有一件虚空的事，就是义人照恶人所行的遭报，又有恶人照义人所行的遭报。我说，这也是虚空。 ###EN### There is a vanity that is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom things happen according to the deeds of the wicked and there are wicked men to whom things happen according to the deeds of the righteous.

Verse_Ch: 8:17 我就看明神一切的作为，知道人查不出日光之下所作的事；因为任凭人劳碌寻索，都找不出来；智慧人虽说他必知道，也找不出来。 ###EN### Then I saw every work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun, because however man labors to seek it out, he will not find it out; and even if the wise man says that he will come to know it, he is not able to find it out.
Chapter_Header: 9
Verse_Ch: 9:1 我将这一切事放在心上，详细考究，就看明义人和智慧人，并他们的作为，都在神手中；或是爱，或是恨，人不能知道；一切都在他们的前面。 ###EN### For all this I laid on my heart, so that I might explain all this, that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God; man knows neither love nor hate; all is before them.
Verse_Ch: 9:2 凡临到众人的事都是一样：义人和恶人，好人、洁净人和不洁净人，献祭的和不献祭的，所遭遇的都是一样。好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的如何， 怕起誓的也如何。 ###EN### All things are alike to all: One thing happens to the righteous man and to the wicked man, to the good and to the clean and to the unclean, to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice; as the good man is, so is the sinner; he who swears is like him who fears an oath.
Verse_Ch: 9:3 在日光之下所行的一切事上有一祸患，就是众人所遭遇的都是一样；并且世人的心充满了恶；他们活着的时候心里狂妄，后来就归死人那里去了。 ###EN### This is an evil among all that is done under the sun, that one thing happens to all; moreover the heart of the children of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live; and after that, they go to the dead.
Verse_Ch: 9:4 与一切活人相连的，那人还有指望，因为活着的狗比死了的狮子更强。 ###EN### For there is hope for whomever is joined to all the living-surely a living dog is better than a dead lion -
Verse_Ch: 9:5 活着的人知道自己必死；死了的人却毫无所知，也不再得赏赐；他们的名被人遗忘。 ###EN### For the living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.
Verse_Ch: 9:6 他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒，早都消灭了；在日光之下所行的一切事上，他们永不再有分了。 ###EN### Their love, their hate, and their envy have already perished, nor do they have some portion yet in all that is done under the sun forever.

Verse_Ch: 9:8 你的衣服当时常洁白，你的头上也不要缺少膏油。 ###EN### Let your garments always be white, and do not let oil be lacking on your head.
Verse_Ch: 9:9 在你一生虚空的日子，就是神赐你在日光之下一切虚空的日子，当同你所爱的妻子，享受人生，因为那是你一生在日光之下劳碌的事上所得的分。 ###EN### Enjoy life with the wife whom you have loved all the days of your life of vanity which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity; for this is your portion in life and in your labor by which you have labored under the sun.
Verse_Ch: 9:10 凡你手所当作的事要尽力去作；因为在你所要去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。 ###EN### Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, where you are going.
Verse_Ch: 9:11 我又见日光之下快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，并且智慧的未必得粮食，聪明的未必得赀财，有知识的也未必得喜悦；所临到众人的，是在于时 候和机会。 ###EN### Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor is the battle to the mighty, nor is even the bread to the wise, nor are riches to those who have understanding, nor is favor to those who have knowledge; but time and chance happen to them all.
Verse_Ch: 9:12 原来人也不知道自己的时候：鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中也是如此。 ###EN### For also man does not know his time: Like fish that are caught in a deadly net and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of men are ensnared in an evil time when it falls suddenly on them.
Verse_Ch: 9:13 我也见日光之下有一件事乃是智慧，据我看是大的， ###EN### This also I have seen as wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
Verse_Ch: 9:14 就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，将城围困，修筑高垒攻打。 ###EN### There was a small city with a few men in it; and a great king came against it and surrounded it and built great siegeworks against it.
Verse_Ch: 9:15 城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。 ###EN### And in it there was found a poor wise man, and he delivered the city by his wisdom; yet no one remembered that poor man.
Verse_Ch: 9:16 我就说，智慧胜过勇力；然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。 ###EN### So I said, Wisdom is better than strength; but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heard.
Verse_Ch: 9:17 智慧人在安静中所说的话，比掌权者在愚昧人中的喊声更有人听。 ###EN### The words of the wise man spoken quietly are heeded more than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
Verse_Ch: 9:18 智慧胜过打仗的兵器；但一个罪人能败坏许多善事。 ###EN### Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.

Verse_Ch: 10:1 死苍蝇使调制香料者的膏油变臭发酵；这样，一点愚昧也败坏智慧和尊荣。 ###EN### Dead flies cause the perfumer's ointment to stink, to ferment; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
Verse_Ch: 10:2 智慧人的心偏右；愚昧人的心偏左。 ###EN### A wise man's heart inclines to his right, but a fool's heart inclines to his left.

Verse_Ch: 10:4 掌权者若向你生气，你不要离开本位，因为柔和能免大过。 ###EN### If the ruler's spirit rises up against you, do not leave your place; for composure allays great offenses.
Verse_Ch: 10:5 我见日光之下有一祸患，似乎出于掌权者的错误， ###EN### There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, like an error that proceeds from the ruler:
Verse_Ch: 10:6 就是愚昧人多居高位，富足人坐在低位。 ###EN### Folly is set in many high places, and rich men sit in a low place.
Verse_Ch: 10:7 我见过仆人骑马，首领像仆人在地上步行。 ###EN### I have seen servants on horses and princes walking on the earth like servants.
Verse_Ch: 10:8 挖陷坑的，自己必掉在其中；拆通墙垣的，必为蛇所咬。 ###EN### He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent;
Verse_Ch: 10:9 开凿石头的，必受损伤；劈开木头的，必遭危险。 ###EN### Whoever quarries stones will be hurt by them, and whoever splits logs will be endangered by them.
Verse_Ch: 10:10 铁器钝了，若不将刃磨快，就必多费力气；但智慧有益，使人成功。 ###EN### If the iron is blunt, and one does not whet the edge, then he must apply more strength; but wisdom has the advantage of giving success.

Verse_Ch: 10:12 智慧人的口说出恩言，愚昧人的嘴吞灭自己。 ###EN### The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool swallow him up.
Verse_Ch: 10:13 他口中的言语起头是愚昧；他话的末尾是奸恶的狂妄。 ###EN### The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly, and the end of his talk is wicked madness.
Verse_Ch: 10:14 愚昧人多言多语。人不知将来有什么事；他身后的事谁能告诉他呢？ ###EN### Yet the fool multiplies words. No man knows what will be; and what will be after him, who can tell him?
Verse_Ch: 10:15 愚昧人的劳碌使自己困乏，因为连如何进城他也不知道。 ###EN### The labor of fools wears them out, because they do not know even how to get to town.
Verse_Ch: 10:16 邦国阿，你的王若是孩童，你的众首领早晨吃喝宴乐，你就有祸了！ ###EN### Woe to you, O land whose king is a young boy and whose princes feast in the morning!
Verse_Ch: 10:17 邦国阿，你的王若是贵胄之子，你的众首领按时吃喝，为要补力，不为酒醉，你就有福了！ ###EN### Happy are you, O land whose king is the son of nobles and whose princes feast at the proper time, for strength and not for drunkenness!
