Verse_Ch: 34:6 我岂能说谎违背我的理？我虽无过，受的箭伤却无法医治。 ###EN### Should I lie against my right? My arrow wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.
Verse_Ch: 34:7 谁像约伯，喝讥诮如同喝水， ###EN### What man is like Job, Who drinks up scoffing like water,
Verse_Ch: 34:8 与作孽的结伴而行，和恶人一同行走呢？ ###EN### Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity And walks with wicked men?
Verse_Ch: 34:9 他说，人以神为乐，总是无益。 ###EN### For he has said, It does not profit a man To delight himself in God.
Verse_Ch: 34:10 所以你们明理的人要听我的话：神断不至行恶，全能者断不至作孽。 ###EN### Therefore, you men of understanding, hear me: Far be it from God that He would do evil, And from the Almighty that He would commit iniquity.

Verse_Ch: 34:17 难道恨恶公理的，可以掌权么？那公义且有大能的，你岂可定为有罪呢？ ###EN### Shall one who hates justice govern? And will you condemn the just and mighty One,
Verse_Ch: 34:18 祂对君王说，你是卑劣的！对贵胄说，你是邪恶的！ ###EN### He who says to a king, You worthless one! And to nobles, You wicked one!
Verse_Ch: 34:19 祂不徇掌权者的情面，也不看重富足的过于贫穷的；因为他们都是祂手所造的。 ###EN### He who does not respect the persons of princes, Nor regard the rich man more than the poor, For they are all the work of His hands?
Verse_Ch: 34:20 在转眼之间，半夜之中，他们就死亡；百姓被震动而去世，有权势的被除灭非借人手。 ###EN### In a moment they die, and in the middle of the night The people are shaken, and they pass away; And the mighty are taken away, but by no human hand.
Verse_Ch: 34:21 因为神注目观看人的道路，看明人一切的脚步。 ###EN### For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps.
Verse_Ch: 34:22 没有黑暗和死荫，能给作孽的藏身。 ###EN### There is no darkness and no shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

Verse_Ch: 34:24 祂不必查究，就打破有势力的人，设立别人代替他们。 ###EN### He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry And puts others in their stead.
Verse_Ch: 34:25 因此祂知道他们的行为，在夜间倾覆他们，使他们被压碎。 ###EN### Hence He knows their actions, And He overturns them in the night so that they are crushed.
Verse_Ch: 34:26 祂在众人眼前击打他们，如同击打恶人一样； ###EN### He strikes them as He would evil men, In a place where all can see;
Verse_Ch: 34:27 因为他们偏离不跟从祂，也不留心祂一切的道路， ###EN### Because they turned aside from following after Him And would not regard any of His ways,
Verse_Ch: 34:28 以致贫穷人的哀声达到祂那里，祂也听了困苦人的哀声。 ###EN### So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And He heard the cry of the afflicted.
Verse_Ch: 34:29 祂若静默，谁能定罪祂？祂若掩面，谁能看见祂？无论待一国或一人，都是如此， ###EN### When He is silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can behold Him? He does so toward a nation and toward a man alike,
Verse_Ch: 34:30 使不虔敬的人不得作王，免得有人牢笼百姓。 ###EN### That no profane man would reign, that there would be no snares for the people.
Verse_Ch: 34:31 有谁对神说，我担受了责罚，不再有败坏的行为了； ###EN### For has anyone ever said to God, I have borne chastisement; I will offend no more;
Verse_Ch: 34:32 我所看不明的，求你指教我；我若作了孽，必不再作？ ###EN### What I do not see teach me; If I have committed iniquity, I will do it no more?
Verse_Ch: 34:33 祂施行报应，岂因你拒绝不受，就随你的心愿么？要作拣选的是你，不是我；你所知道的，只管说罢。 ###EN### Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected it? For you must choose, and not I. So speak what you know.
Verse_Ch: 34:34 明理的人，和听我话的智慧人，必对我说， ###EN### Men of understanding will say to me, As well as the man of wisdom who hears me,
Verse_Ch: 34:35 约伯说话没有知识，言语中毫无见识。 ###EN### Job has spoken without knowledge, And his words are without insight.
Verse_Ch: 34:36 我愿约伯被试验到底，因他回答像恶人一样。 ###EN### I wish that Job were tried to the limit Because of his answering like evil men.
Verse_Ch: 34:37 他在罪上又加悖逆；在我们中间拍掌，用许多言语顶撞神。 ###EN### For he adds rebellion to his sin; Among us he claps his hands And multiplies his words against God.
Chapter_Header: 35
Verse_Ch: 35:1 以利户继续说， ###EN### Then Elihu continued and said,
Verse_Ch: 35:2 你说，我的公义胜于神的公义；你以为这样说有理， ###EN### Do you consider this to be just, Do you say, My righteousness is more than God's,
Verse_Ch: 35:3 所以才说，这与我有什么益处？我不犯罪比犯罪有什么好处？ ###EN### That you say, What advantage is there to me, What do I profit, more than if I had sinned?
Verse_Ch: 35:4 我要用言语回答你，和在你这里的朋友。 ###EN### I will respond to you with words, And to your companions with you.
Verse_Ch: 35:5 你当向天观看，瞻望那高于你的穹苍。 ###EN### Look unto heaven and see; And behold the skies: They are higher than you.
Verse_Ch: 35:6 你若犯罪，对神能造成什么妨碍？你的过犯增多，对神能作出什么损害？ ###EN### If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?
Verse_Ch: 35:7 你若是公义，能给祂什么？或者祂能从你手里接受什么？ ###EN### If you are righteous, what can you give to Him, Or what does He receive from your hand?
Verse_Ch: 35:8 你的邪恶只能害像你这样的人，你的公义只能叫世人得益处。 ###EN### Your wickedness affects a man like you, And your righteousness, a son of man.
Verse_Ch: 35:9 人因多受欺压就哀求，因强权者的辖制便呼救； ###EN### Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
Verse_Ch: 35:10 却无人说，造我的神在那里？祂使人夜间歌唱， ###EN### But no one says, Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,
Verse_Ch: 35:11 教训我们胜于地上的走兽，使我们有智慧胜于空中的飞鸟。 ###EN### Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?
Verse_Ch: 35:12 他们在那里，因恶人的骄傲呼求，祂却不答应。 ###EN### There they cry, but He does not answer, Because of the pride of evil men.
Verse_Ch: 35:13 虚妄的呼求，神必不垂听，全能者也必不理会。 ###EN### Surely God does not hear an empty cry, And the Almighty does not regard it.
Verse_Ch: 35:14 何况你说，你不得见祂，你的案件在祂面前，你正等候祂！ ###EN### How much less when you say that you do not behold Him, That the cause is before Him and you are waiting on Him!
Verse_Ch: 35:15 但如今因祂未曾在怒中查究，也不甚理会狂傲， ###EN### But now, because He has not visited in His anger Nor regarded such great arrogance,
Verse_Ch: 35:16 所以约伯开口说虚妄的话，多发无知识的言语。 ###EN### Job opens his mouth in vanity; He multiplies words without knowledge.
Chapter_Header: 36
