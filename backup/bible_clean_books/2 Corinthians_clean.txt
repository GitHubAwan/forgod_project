Verse_Ch: 1:1 凭神旨意，作基督耶稣使徒的保罗，和弟兄提摩太，写信给在哥林多神的召会，同着在全亚该亚的众圣徒： ###EN### Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
Verse_Ch: 1:2 愿恩典与平安，从神我们的父，并主耶稣基督归与你们。 ###EN### Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Verse_Ch: 1:3 我们主耶稣基督的神与父，就是那怜恤人的父，和赐诸般安慰的神，是当受颂赞的； ###EN### Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort;
Verse_Ch: 1:4 祂在我们一切的患难中安慰我们，叫我们能用自己从神所受的安慰，安慰那些在各样患难中的人。 ###EN### Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
Verse_Ch: 1:5 因为基督的苦难怎样满溢到我们身上，照样我们所受的安慰，也借着基督而洋溢。 ###EN### For even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our comfort also abounds.
Verse_Ch: 1:6 我们或是受患难，是为了你们受安慰，得拯救；或是受安慰，也是为了你们受安慰；这安慰叫你们能忍受我们所受的同样苦难。 ###EN### But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comforting and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comforting, which operates in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.
Verse_Ch: 1:7 我们为你们所存的盼望是确定的，知道你们既是同受苦难，也必照样同受安慰。 ###EN### And our hope for you is firm, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you are of the comfort.
Verse_Ch: 1:8 弟兄们，关于我们在亚西亚所遭遇的患难，我们不愿意你们不知道，就是我们被压太重，力不能胜，甚至连活命的指望都绝了， ###EN### For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.
Verse_Ch: 1:9 自己里面也断定是必死的，叫我们不信靠自己，只信靠那叫死人复活的神； ###EN### Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead;
Verse_Ch: 1:10 祂曾救我们脱离那极大的死亡，并且仍要救我们，我们指望祂将来还要救我们， ###EN### Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us,
Verse_Ch: 1:11 只要你们也为着我们以祈求配合帮助，好叫许多人因我们借着许多人所得的恩赐，为我们献上感谢。 ###EN### If you also help in this by petition on our behalf, that for the gift to us through many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.
Verse_Ch: 1:12 我们所夸的，是我们的良心见证我们凭着神的单纯和纯诚，在世为人，不靠属肉体的智慧，乃靠神的恩典，对你们更是这样。 ###EN### For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
Verse_Ch: 1:13 我们写给你们的，并不外乎你们所诵读，甚至所明白的，我也盼望你们能明白到底， ###EN### For no other things do we write to you than what you read or even know; and I hope that you will know unto the end,
Verse_Ch: 1:14 正如你们已经有几分明白我们：我们乃是你们的夸耀，好像在我们主耶稣的日子，你们也是我们的夸耀一样。 ###EN### Even as also you know us in part, that we are your boast, just as you also are ours in the day of our Lord Jesus.
Verse_Ch: 1:15 我既然这样深信，先前就有意到你们那里去，叫你们得着两次的恩典， ###EN### And in this confidence I intended to come to you previously that you might have double grace,
Verse_Ch: 1:16 也要从你们那里经过，往马其顿去，再从马其顿回到你们那里，然后蒙你们送行往犹太去。 ###EN### And through you to pass through into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you and be sent forward by you into Judea.
Verse_Ch: 1:17 我有这样的意思，难道是行事轻浮么？还是我所定的意是按着肉体定的，以致在我有忽是忽非么？ ###EN### This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no?
Verse_Ch: 1:18 但神既是信实的，我们对你们所说的话，就没有是而又非的， ###EN### But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yes and no.
Verse_Ch: 1:19 因为借着我和西拉并提摩太，在你们中间所传神的儿子耶稣基督，并不是是而又非的，在祂只有一是。 ###EN### For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him.
Verse_Ch: 1:20 因为神的应许，不论有多少，在基督里都是是的，所以借着祂，对神也都是阿们的，好叫荣耀借着我们归与神。 ###EN### For as many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us to God.
Verse_Ch: 1:21 然而那把我们同你们，坚固的联于基督，并且膏了我们的，就是神； ###EN### But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God,
Verse_Ch: 1:22 祂既印了我们，又赐那灵在我们心里作质。 ###EN### He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
Verse_Ch: 1:23 我呼求神给我作见证，我还未往哥林多去，是为要宽容你们。 ###EN### But I call on God as a witness against my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.
Verse_Ch: 1:24 我们并不是作主管辖你们的信心，乃是与你们同工，使你们喜乐，因为你们是凭信而立。 ###EN### Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers with you for your joy; for by faith you stand.
Chapter_Header: 2
Verse_Ch: 2:1 但为了我自己，我已经这样断定，不再带着忧愁到你们那里去。 ###EN### But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.
Verse_Ch: 2:2 因为我若叫你们忧愁，这样，除了我叫他忧愁的那人以外，谁能叫我快乐？ ###EN### For if I cause you sorrow, who then is the one who makes me glad, except the one who is made sorrowful by me?
Verse_Ch: 2:3 我曾把这事写给你们，免得我来的时候，那些应该叫我喜乐的人，反倒叫我忧愁；我深信你们众人，都以我的喜乐为你们众人的喜乐。 ###EN### And I wrote this very thing to you that when I come I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.
Verse_Ch: 2:4 我先前由于许多的患难，和心中的困苦，多多的流泪，写信给你们，不是要叫你们忧愁，乃是要叫你们知道，我对你们的爱是格外充盈的。 ###EN### For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.
Verse_Ch: 2:5 只是若有叫人忧愁的，他不是叫我忧愁，乃是有几分叫你们众人忧愁。（我说几分，免得我说得太重。） ###EN### But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me to sorrow, but in part (lest I lay too heavy a burden) all of you.
Verse_Ch: 2:6 这样的人，受了多数人的责罚，也就够了， ###EN### Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,
Verse_Ch: 2:7 你们倒不如饶恕他，安慰他，免得这样的人或者忧愁太过，就被吞灭了。 ###EN### So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.
Verse_Ch: 2:8 所以我劝你们，要向他证实你们的爱。 ###EN### Therefore I exhort you to confirm your love toward him.
Verse_Ch: 2:9 为此我也曾写信给你们，要知道你们经过试验的品德，看你们是否在凡事上都顺从。 ###EN### For to this end also I wrote, that I might know your approvedness, whether you are obedient in all things.
Verse_Ch: 2:10 你们饶恕谁什么，我也饶恕；我若曾有所饶恕，我所已经饶恕的，是在基督的面前，为你们饶恕的； ###EN### But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for also what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the person of Christ;
Verse_Ch: 2:11 免得我们给撒但占了便宜，因我们并非不晓得他的阴谋。 ###EN### That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
Verse_Ch: 2:12 再者，我从前为基督的福音到了特罗亚，借着主也有门向我开了， ###EN### Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was open to me in the Lord,
Verse_Ch: 2:13 那时没有找到我的弟兄提多，我灵里不安，便辞别那里的人，往马其顿去了。 ###EN### I had no rest in my spirit, for I did not find Titus my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.
Verse_Ch: 2:14 感谢神，祂常在基督里，在凯旋的行列中帅领我们，并借着我们在各处显扬那因认识基督而有的香气； ###EN### But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place.
Verse_Ch: 2:15 因为无论在那些正在得救的人中，或是在那些正在灭亡的人中，我们都是献给神的基督馨香之气： ###EN### For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing:
Verse_Ch: 2:16 在这等人，就是出于死的香气叫人死；在那等人，就是出于生命的香气叫人活；对这些事，谁够资格？ ###EN### To some a savor out of death unto death, and to the others a savor out of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
Verse_Ch: 2:17 我们不像那许多人，为利混乱神的话，而是出于纯诚，出于神，在神面前在基督里讲神的话。 ###EN### For we are not like the many, adulterating the word of God for profit; but as out of sincerity, but as out of God, before God we speak in Christ.
Chapter_Header: 3
Verse_Ch: 3:1 我们岂是又开始推荐自己么？岂像有些人，需要给你们荐信，或由你们写荐信么？ ###EN### Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you or from you?
Verse_Ch: 3:2 你们就是我们的信，写在我们的心里，是众人所认识、所诵读的， ###EN### You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men,
Verse_Ch: 3:3 你们显明是基督的信，由我们供职所写的，不是用墨，乃是用活神的灵写的，不是写在石版上，乃是写在肉版，就是心上。 ###EN### Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.
Verse_Ch: 3:4 我们借着基督，对神有这样的深信。 ###EN### And such confidence we have through Christ toward God,
Verse_Ch: 3:5 并不是我们凭自己够资格将什么估计作像是出于我们自己的；我们之所以够资格，乃是出于神； ###EN### Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God,
Verse_Ch: 3:6 祂使我们够资格作新约的执事，这些执事不是属于字句，乃是属于灵，因为那字句杀死人，那灵却叫人活。 ###EN### Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
Verse_Ch: 3:7 若那用字刻在石头上属死的职事，尚且是带着荣光立的，以致以色列子孙因摩西面上渐渐废去的荣光，不能定睛看他的脸， ###EN### Moreover if the ministry of death, engraved in stone in letters, came about in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, a glory which was being done away with,
Verse_Ch: 3:8 何况那灵的职事，岂不更带着荣光？ ###EN### How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory?
Verse_Ch: 3:9 若定罪的职事有荣光，那称义的职事，就越发充盈着荣光了。 ###EN### For if there is glory with the ministry of condemnation, much more the ministry of righteousness abounds with glory.
Verse_Ch: 3:10 那从前得荣光的，在这一点上，因这超越的荣光，就算不得有荣光； ###EN### For also that which has been glorified in this respect has not been glorified on account of the surpassing glory.
Verse_Ch: 3:11 因为那渐渐废去的，如果是经过荣光的，这长存的就更多在荣光里了。 ###EN### For if that which was being done away with was through glory, much more that which remains is in glory.
Verse_Ch: 3:12 所以，我们既有这样的盼望，就大大放胆， ###EN### Therefore since we have such hope, we use much boldness,
Verse_Ch: 3:13 不像摩西将帕子蒙在脸上，为要叫以色列子孙，不能定睛看到那渐渐废去者的结局。 ###EN### And are not like Moses, who put a veil on his face so that the sons of Israel would not gaze at the end of that which was being done away with.
Verse_Ch: 3:14 但他们的心思刚硬，因为直到今日他们诵读旧约的时候，同样的帕子还存留着，他们还未得启示这帕子在基督里已经废去了。 ###EN### But their thoughts were hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, it not being unveiled to them that the veil is being done away with in Christ.
Verse_Ch: 3:15 是的，直到今日，每逢诵读摩西书的时候，帕子还留在他们心上； ###EN### Indeed unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart;
Verse_Ch: 3:16 但他们的心几时转向主，帕子就几时除去了。 ###EN### But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
Verse_Ch: 3:17 而且主就是那灵；主的灵在那里，那里就有自由。 ###EN### And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
Verse_Ch: 3:18 但我们众人既然以没有帕子遮蔽的脸，好像镜子观看并返照主的荣光，就渐渐变化成为与祂同样的形像，从荣耀到荣耀，乃是从主灵变化成的。 ###EN### But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
Chapter_Header: 4
Verse_Ch: 4:1 因此，我们既照所蒙的怜悯，受了这职事，就不丧胆， ###EN### Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart;
Verse_Ch: 4:2 乃将那些可耻隐密的事弃绝了，不以诡诈行事，也不搀混神的话，只将真理显扬出来，藉以在神面前将自己荐与各人的良心。 ###EN### But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.
Verse_Ch: 4:3 如果我们的福音真的受蒙蔽，也是蒙蔽在灭亡的人身上； ###EN### And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing,
Verse_Ch: 4:4 在他们里面，这世代的神弄瞎了他们这不信者的心思，叫基督荣耀之福音的光照，不照亮他们；基督本是神的像。 ###EN### In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.
Verse_Ch: 4:5 因为我们不是传自己，乃是传基督耶稣为主，也传自己为耶稣的缘故，作你们的奴仆。 ###EN### For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake.
Verse_Ch: 4:6 因为那说光要从黑暗里照出来的神，已经照在我们心里，为着光照人，使人认识那显在耶稣基督面上之神的荣耀。 ###EN### Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
Verse_Ch: 4:7 但我们有这宝贝在瓦器里，要显明这超越的能力，是属于神，不是出于我们； ###EN### But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.
Verse_Ch: 4:8 我们四面受压，却不被困住；出路绝了，却非绝无出路； ###EN### We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out;
Verse_Ch: 4:9 遭逼迫，却不被撇弃；打倒了，却不至灭亡； ###EN### Persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed;
Verse_Ch: 4:10 身体上常带着耶稣的治死，使耶稣的生命也显明在我们的身体上。 ###EN### Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
Verse_Ch: 4:11 因为我们这活着的人，是常为耶稣被交于死，使耶稣的生命，也在我们这必死的肉身上显明出来。 ###EN### For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
Verse_Ch: 4:12 这样，死是在我们身上发动，生命却在你们身上发动。 ###EN### So then death operates in us, but life in you.
Verse_Ch: 4:13 并且照经上所记：“我信，所以我说话；”我们既有这同样信心的灵，也就信，所以也就说话， ###EN### And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, "I believed, therefore I spoke,'' we also believe, therefore we also speak,
Verse_Ch: 4:14 知道那叫主耶稣复活的，也必叫我们与耶稣一同复活，并且叫我们与你们一同站在祂面前。 ###EN### Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will make us stand before Him with you.
Verse_Ch: 4:15 因为凡事都是为你们，好叫恩典借着更多的人而增多，使感谢洋溢，以致荣耀归与神。 ###EN### For all things are for your sakes that the grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
Verse_Ch: 4:16 所以我们不丧胆，反而我们外面的人虽然在毁坏，我们里面的人却日日在更新。 ###EN### Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
Verse_Ch: 4:17 因为我们这短暂轻微的苦楚，要极尽超越的为我们成就永远重大的荣耀。 ###EN### For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory,
Verse_Ch: 4:18 我们原不是顾念所见的，乃是顾念所不见的，因为所见的是暂时的，所不见的才是永远的。 ###EN### Because we do not regard the things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
Chapter_Header: 5
Verse_Ch: 5:1 因为我们知道，我们这地上的帐幕房屋若拆毁了，必得着从神来的房舍，非人手所造，在诸天之上永远的房屋。 ###EN### For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 5:2 原来我们确是在这帐幕里叹息，深想穿上我们从天上来的住处； ###EN### For also in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven,
Verse_Ch: 5:3 若真的穿上，就不至于显为赤身了。 ###EN### If indeed, being clothed, we will not be found naked.
Verse_Ch: 5:4 因为我们在这帐幕里的人，负重叹息，是因不愿脱下这个，乃愿穿上那个，好叫这必死的被生命吞灭了。 ###EN### For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
Verse_Ch: 5:5 那为这事培植我们的乃是神，祂已将那灵赐给我们作质。 ###EN### Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge.
Verse_Ch: 5:6 所以我们常是放心振作，并且晓得我们居家在身内，便是离家与主分开； ###EN### Therefore being always of good courage and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abroad from the Lord
Verse_Ch: 5:7 （因我们行事为人，是凭着信心，不是凭着眼见；） ( ###EN### For we walk by faith, not by appearance) --
Verse_Ch: 5:8 是的，我们是放心振作，宁愿离家出到身外，与主同在家中。 ###EN### We are of good courage then and are well pleased rather to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord.
Verse_Ch: 5:9 所以我们也怀着雄心大志，无论是在家，或是离家，都要讨主的喜悦。 ###EN### Therefore also we are determined, whether at home or abroad, to gain the honor of being well pleasing to Him.
Verse_Ch: 5:10 因为我们众人，必要在基督的审判台前显露出来，叫各人按着本身所行的，或善或恶，受到应得的报应。 ###EN### For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.
Verse_Ch: 5:11 所以我们既晓得主的可畏，就劝服人，但我们向神是显明的，只是我盼望在你们的良心里，也是显明的。 ###EN### Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; yet I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
Verse_Ch: 5:12 我们不是再向你们推荐自己，乃是给你们一个为我们夸耀的机会，好叫你们对那凭外貌不凭内心夸口的人，有可应对的。 ###EN### We are not again commending ourselves to you, but so speak in order to give you an opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who are boasting in outward appearance and not in heart.
Verse_Ch: 5:13 因我们或是癫狂，乃是向着神；或是谨守，乃是为着你们。 ###EN### For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.
Verse_Ch: 5:14 原来基督的爱困迫我们，因我们断定：一人既替众人死，众人就都死了； ###EN### For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died;
Verse_Ch: 5:15 并且祂替众人死，是叫那些活着的人，不再向自己活，乃向那替他们死而复活者活。 ###EN### And He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.
Verse_Ch: 5:16 所以我们从今以后，不按着肉体认人了；虽然按着肉体认过基督，如今却不再这样认祂了。 ###EN### So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.
Verse_Ch: 5:17 因此，若有人在基督里，他就是新造；旧事已过，看哪，都变成新的了。 ###EN### So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.
Verse_Ch: 5:18 一切都是出于神，祂借着基督使我们与祂自己和好，又将这和好的职事赐给我们； ###EN### But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
Verse_Ch: 5:19 这就是神在基督里，叫世人与祂自己和好，不将他们的过犯算给他们，且将这和好的话语托付了我们。 ###EN### Namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation.
Verse_Ch: 5:20 所以我们为基督作了大使，就好像神藉我们劝你们一样；我们替基督求你们：要与神和好。 ###EN### On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.
Verse_Ch: 5:21 神使那不知罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在祂里面成为神的义。 ###EN### Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
Chapter_Header: 6
Verse_Ch: 6:1 而且我们既与神同工，也就劝你们不可徒受祂的恩典， ###EN### And working together with Him, we also entreat you not to receive the grace of God in vain;
Verse_Ch: 6:2 因为祂说，“在悦纳的时候，我应允了你；在拯救的日子，我济助了你。”看哪，现在正是最可蒙悦纳的时候；看哪，现在正是拯救的日子。 ###EN### For He says, "In an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.'' Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
Verse_Ch: 6:3 我们凡事都不使人绊跌，免得这职事被人挑剔， ###EN### We give no occasion of stumbling in anything that the ministry may not be faulted,
Verse_Ch: 6:4 反倒在各样的事上，在多方的忍耐上、在患难上、在贫困上、在困苦上、 ###EN### But in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
Verse_Ch: 6:5 在鞭打上、在监禁上、在扰乱上、在劳苦上、在不睡上、在不食上， ###EN### In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
Verse_Ch: 6:6 以纯洁、以知识、以恒忍、以恩慈、以圣别的灵、以无伪的爱、 ###EN### In pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love,
Verse_Ch: 6:7 以真实的话、以神的大能，借着在右在左义的兵器， ###EN### In the word of truth, in the power of God; through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left,
Verse_Ch: 6:8 借着荣耀和羞辱，借着恶名和美名，证荐自己是神的执事；似乎是迷惑人的，却是真诚的； ###EN### Through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true;
Verse_Ch: 6:9 似乎不为人所知，却是人所共知的；似乎在死，看哪，我们却活着；似乎受管教，却不被治死； ###EN### As unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death;
Verse_Ch: 6:10 似乎忧愁，却常常喜乐；似乎贫穷，却叫许多人富足；似乎一无所有，却拥有万有。 ###EN### As made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things.
Verse_Ch: 6:11 哥林多人哪，我们的口向你们是张开的，我们的心是宽宏的； ###EN### Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians; our heart is enlarged.
Verse_Ch: 6:12 在我们里面，你们并不受限制，你们乃是限制在自己的心肠里。 ###EN### You are not constricted in us, but you are constricted in your inward parts.
Verse_Ch: 6:13 但你们也要宽宏，作同样的报答，我像对孩子说的。 ###EN### But for a recompense in kind, I speak as to children, you also be enlarged.
Verse_Ch: 6:14 你们跟不信的，不要不配的同负一轭，因为义和不法有什么合伙？光对黑暗有什么交通？ ###EN### Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
Verse_Ch: 6:15 基督对彼列有什么和谐？信的同不信的有什么同分？ ###EN### And what concord does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?
Verse_Ch: 6:16 神的殿同偶像有什么一致？因为我们是活神的殿，就如神曾说，“我要在他们中间居住，在他们中间行走；我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。” ###EN### And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, even as God said, "I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.''
Verse_Ch: 6:17 所以，“主说，你们务要从他们中间出来，得以分别，不要沾不洁之物，我就收纳你们。” ###EN### Therefore "come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'';
Verse_Ch: 6:18 “我要作你们的父，你们要作我的儿子和女儿。这是全能的主说的。” " ###EN### And I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.''
Chapter_Header: 7
Verse_Ch: 7:1 所以亲爱的，我们既有这些应许，就当洁净自己，除去肉身和灵一切的玷污，敬畏神，以成全圣别。 ###EN### Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Verse_Ch: 7:2 你们要容纳我们，我们未曾亏负谁，未曾败坏谁，未曾占谁的便宜。 ###EN### Make room for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.
Verse_Ch: 7:3 我说这话，不是为定罪你们，因我先前说过，你们是在我们的心里，以至同死同活。 ###EN### I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for our dying together and our living together.
Verse_Ch: 7:4 我向你们大大的放胆，我为你们多多的夸口；我满得安慰，在我们一切的患难中，我格外的洋溢喜乐。 ###EN### Great is my boldness toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
Verse_Ch: 7:5 原来我们就是到了马其顿，我们的肉身也不得安宁，反而凡事遭患难，外有争战，内有惧怕。 ###EN### For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in everything; without were fightings, within were fears.
Verse_Ch: 7:6 但那安慰颓丧之人的神，借着提多来，安慰了我们； ###EN### But He who comforts those who are downcast, that is, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
Verse_Ch: 7:7 不但借着他来，也借着他在你们身上所得的安慰，安慰了我们，因他把你们的切望、你们的哀恸、和你们为我的热心，都告诉了我们，叫我更加喜乐。 ###EN### And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted because of you, declaring to us your longing, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.
Verse_Ch: 7:8 我虽曾写信叫你们忧愁，我并不懊悔；虽然我曾懊悔过，（因我晓得那信曾叫你们忧愁，尽管是一时的，） ###EN### For though I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did regret it (for I see that that letter, even if for an hour, caused you sorrow),
Verse_Ch: 7:9 如今我却喜乐，不是因你们忧愁，乃是因你们忧愁以致悔改，因为你们照着神忧愁，就不至于在任何事上，因我们受亏损了。 ###EN### Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us.
Verse_Ch: 7:10 因为照着神忧愁，生出悔改以致得救，是没有后悔的，但世上的忧愁是产生死亡。 ###EN### For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret; but the sorrow of the world works out death.
Verse_Ch: 7:11 且看这事，你们照着神忧愁，在你们中间已产生何等的热诚、甚而自诉、甚而愤恨、甚而惧怕、甚而切望、甚而热心、甚而责罚。在各方面，你们都 证荐自己在那件事上是纯洁的。 ###EN### For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it has worked out in you, indeed what defense, indeed what indignation, indeed what fear, indeed what longing, indeed what zeal, indeed what punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in the matter.
Verse_Ch: 7:12 因此，我虽曾写信给你们，却不是为那亏负人的，也不是为那受亏负的，乃是为要在神面前，向你们显明你们对我们的热诚。 ###EN### So then, though I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but for the sake of manifesting to you before God your earnestness for us.
Verse_Ch: 7:13 所以我们得了安慰，并且在这安慰之外，我们因提多的喜乐，就越发更加喜乐，因他的灵从你们众人得了畅快。 ###EN### Because of this we have been comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
Verse_Ch: 7:14 因为我若对提多夸奖了你们什么，也不觉得羞愧。相反的，我们对你们所说的一切事，怎样是真实的，我们在提多面前所夸奖你们的，也怎样成了真 实的。 ###EN### For if in anything I boasted to him on your behalf, I have not been put to shame; on the contrary, as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting before Titus turned out to be the truth.
Verse_Ch: 7:15 并且提多想起你们众人的顺从，就是怎样恐惧战兢的接待他，他的心肠就越发倾向你们了。 ###EN### And his affections are abundantly toward you, he remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
Verse_Ch: 7:16 我如今喜乐，能在凡事上为你们放心。 ###EN### I rejoice that in everything I have boldness because of you.
Chapter_Header: 8
Verse_Ch: 8:1 还有，弟兄们，我们把神在马其顿众召会中所赐的恩典告诉你们， ###EN### Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,
Verse_Ch: 8:2 就是在患难中受大试验的时候，他们充盈的喜乐，和极深的贫困，汇溢出丰厚的慷慨。 ###EN### That in much proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality;
Verse_Ch: 8:3 我可以见证，他们是按着能力，而且也过了能力， ###EN### That according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, of their own accord,
Verse_Ch: 8:4 自愿的多方恳求，向我们要求这供给圣徒的恩典和交通， ###EN### With much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints;
Verse_Ch: 8:5 并且他们未照着我们所盼望的，反而凭着神的旨意，先把自己给了主，也给了我们， ###EN### And this, not as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.
Verse_Ch: 8:6 以致我们劝提多，他怎样开始了，也当照样为你们完成这恩典，像完成其他的事一样。 ###EN### So we entreated Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete for you this grace as well.
Verse_Ch: 8:7 但你们当在这恩典上也充盈满溢，像你们在凡事上，在信心，在言语，在知识，在一切的热诚，并在那出于我们而在你们里面的爱心上，都充盈满溢 一样。 ###EN### But just as you abound in everything, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love in you from us, abound in this grace also.
Verse_Ch: 8:8 我说这话，不是命令你们，乃是借着别人的热诚，也试验你们爱的真实。 ###EN### I am not speaking by way of command but through the earnestness of others, proving also the genuineness of your love.
Verse_Ch: 8:9 你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典，祂本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因祂的贫穷，可以成为富足。 ###EN### For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich.
Verse_Ch: 8:10 我在这事上提出意见，因这是与你们有益的；你们不但在实行上，也在意愿上，在一年前就先开始了， ###EN### And I give my opinion in this matter, for this is profitable for you who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this but even to intend to do this.
Verse_Ch: 8:11 如今也当办成这事，好叫你们怎样有愿作的热切，也怎样照所有的办成， ###EN### But now complete also the doing, so that as there was the eagerness in intending, so also there would be the completing out of what you have.
Verse_Ch: 8:12 因为人若热切愿作，必蒙悦纳，乃是照他所有的，不是照他所无的。 ###EN### For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have.
Verse_Ch: 8:13 这原不是要别人轻省，你们为难， ###EN### For it is not that to others there would be relief, yet to you affliction,
Verse_Ch: 8:14 乃是要出于均平，就是要你们的富余，今时可以补他们的不足，为使他们的富余，将来也可以补你们的不足，这就均平了； ###EN### But it is out of equality; at the present time your abundance for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack, so that there may be equality;
Verse_Ch: 8:15 如经上所记：“多收的没有余，少收的也没有缺。” ###EN### As it is written, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.''
Verse_Ch: 8:16 感谢神，把我为你们同样的热诚，赐在提多心里， ###EN### But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus,
Verse_Ch: 8:17 因他固然接受了恳求，但自己更是热诚，自愿往你们那里去。 ###EN### Because he not only received the entreaty, but being more earnest, he also went forth of his own accord to you.
Verse_Ch: 8:18 我们还打发一位弟兄和他同去，这人在福音上普遍的为众召会所称赞。 ###EN### And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches,
Verse_Ch: 8:19 不但这样，他也被众召会选出，在我们所服事的这恩典上，和我们同行，是为着主自己的荣耀，也是为着我们的热切。 ###EN### And not only this, but who has also been by the churches as our fellow traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord Himself and to demonstrate our eagerness;
Verse_Ch: 8:20 这就避免人在我们所服事的这丰裕上，挑剔我们， ###EN### Avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us.
Verse_Ch: 8:21 因为我们留心作善美可敬的事，不但在主面前，也在人面前。 ###EN### For we exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.
Verse_Ch: 8:22 我们又打发我们的弟兄和他们同去，这人是我们在许多事上，屡次试证为殷勤的，现在他因对你们极其深信，就极其更加殷勤了。 ###EN### And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times, yet now much more diligent because of the great confidence he has toward you.
Verse_Ch: 8:23 论到提多，他是我的同伙和为着你们的同工；至于我们的弟兄们，他们是众召会的使徒，是基督的荣耀。 ###EN### Whether concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you; or our brothers, they are apostles of the churches, they are Christ's glory.
Verse_Ch: 8:24 所以你们要在众召会面前，向他们显示你们爱心的明证，并我们为你们夸耀的明证。 ###EN### Show therefore to them, in the face of the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf.
Chapter_Header: 9
Verse_Ch: 9:1 关于供给圣徒的事，写信给你们，于我原是多余的。 ###EN### For concerning the ministry to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;
Verse_Ch: 9:2 因为我知道你们的热切，就是我常对马其顿人所夸耀你们的，说亚该亚人在一年前就预备好了；你们的热心便激动了许多人。 ###EN### For I know your eagerness, of which I boast on your behalf to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stirred up the greater number of them.
Verse_Ch: 9:3 但我打发那几位弟兄去，使我们在这方面为你们所夸耀的，不至于落空，好叫你们照我所说的预备好， ###EN### But I sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf might not be made void in this respect, that, as I said, you might be prepared;
Verse_Ch: 9:4 免得万一有马其顿人与我同去，发现你们没有预备好，就叫我们所确信的蒙羞，你们就更不用说了。 ###EN### Lest, if the Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, be put to shame in this confidence.
Verse_Ch: 9:5 所以，我想必须劝那几位弟兄先到你们那里去，把你们先前所应许的祝福事前安排好，使这事如此预备好了，就成为受者的祝福，而不成为施者的贪 婪。 ###EN### Therefore I thought it necessary to entreat the brothers to go before to you and make ready beforehand your previously promised blessing, that thus this might be ready as a blessing and not as a matter of covetousness.
Verse_Ch: 9:6 还有，少种的少收，多种的多收。 ###EN### But take note of this: He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap;
Verse_Ch: 9:7 各人要照心里所酌定的，不要作难，不要勉强，因为神喜爱乐意施与的人。 ###EN### Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.
Verse_Ch: 9:8 神能使各样的恩典向你们洋溢，使你们在凡事上常常十分充足，能洋溢出各样的善工。 ###EN### And God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work;
Verse_Ch: 9:9 就如经上所记：“他分施周济贫贱，他的义存到永远。” ###EN### Even as it is written, "He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness abides forever.''
Verse_Ch: 9:10 那丰富供应种子给撒种者，并丰富供应粮食作食物的，必供应并繁增你们的种子，又增添你们义的果子， ###EN### Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of your righteousness to increase.
Verse_Ch: 9:11 使你们凡事富足，以致十分慷慨，就借着我们对神生出感谢； ###EN### You in everything are being enriched unto all liberality, which works out through us thanksgiving to God,
Verse_Ch: 9:12 因为这服事的供应，不但补足圣徒的缺乏，也借着许多对神的感谢而洋溢。 ###EN### Because the ministry of this service is not only filling up the lack of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God.
Verse_Ch: 9:13 他们因着你们承认基督的福音而有的服从，以及你们对他们和众人慷慨的交通，就称许这供给的事，藉以荣耀神。 ###EN### They, through the approving of this ministry, are glorifying God based upon the subjection unto the gospel of Christ that issues from your confession, and upon the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all;
Verse_Ch: 9:14 他们也因神在你们身上超越的恩典，切切的想念你们，为你们祈求。 ###EN### While in petition on your behalf they also long after you on account of the surpassing grace of God upon you.
Verse_Ch: 9:15 感谢神，为着祂难以形容的恩赐。 ###EN### Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
Chapter_Header: 10
Verse_Ch: 10:1 然而我保罗，就是那如你们所说，在你们中间，见面的时候是卑鄙的，不在的时候，向你们却是放胆的，亲自借着基督的温柔与和蔼劝你们， ###EN### But I myself, Paul, entreat you through the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who (as you say) in person am base among you, but while absent am bold toward you,
Verse_Ch: 10:2 我甚至求你们不要叫我同在的时候，因自信而放胆，我凭这自信认为，我该勇敢对付那些认为我们是照着肉体行事的人。 ###EN### I beseech you that when present I would not have to be bold in the confidence with which I count myself, to dare do to some who count us as ones who are walking according to flesh.
Verse_Ch: 10:3 因为我们虽然在肉体中行事，却不照着肉体争战。 ###EN### For though we walk in flesh, we do not war according to flesh;
Verse_Ch: 10:4 我们争战的兵器，本不是属肉体的，乃是在神面前有能力，可以攻倒坚固的营垒， ###EN### For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds,
Verse_Ch: 10:5 将理论和各样阻挡人认识神而立起的高寨，都攻倒了，又将各样的思想掳来，使它顺从基督， ###EN### As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ.
Verse_Ch: 10:6 并且我们已经预备好了，等你们完全顺从的时候，要责罚一切的不顺从。 ###EN### And we are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.
Verse_Ch: 10:7 你们是按外表看事情。若有人自信是属基督的，关于他自己，他要再想想，他是怎样属基督，我们也怎样是。 ###EN### You look at things according to their appearance. If someone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him take account of this again concerning himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we.
Verse_Ch: 10:8 主赐给我们的权柄，是为建造，并不是为拆毁你们，我即使为这权柄稍微过多的夸口，也不至于惭愧。 ###EN### For even if I should boast somewhat more abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord has given for building you up and not for overthrowing you, I will not be put to shame.
Verse_Ch: 10:9 我说这话，为免我像是写信威吓你们。 ###EN### I say this so as not to seem as if I am terrifying you through my letters,
Verse_Ch: 10:10 因为有人说，他的信又沉重，又强硬，他亲身的同在却是软弱，言语又是可鄙。 ###EN### Because while his letters, someone says, are weighty and strong, his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.
Verse_Ch: 10:11 这等人当想，我们不在的时候，信上的言语怎样，同在的时候，行事也必怎样。 ###EN### Let such a one take account of this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also we are in deed when present.
Verse_Ch: 10:12 因为我们不敢将自己，和那些自荐的人同列相比，他们拿自己度量自己，拿自己比较自己，乃是不通达的。 ###EN### For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with any of those who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
Verse_Ch: 10:13 我们却不要过了度量夸口，只要照度量的神所分给我们尺度的度量夸口，这度量甚至远达你们。 ###EN### But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you.
Verse_Ch: 10:14 我们并非过度伸展自己，好像达不到你们，因为在基督的福音上，我们是最先来的，甚至远及你们。 ###EN### For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you, for we were the first to come even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ.
Verse_Ch: 10:15 我们不凭别人的劳碌过度夸口，但盼望随着你们信心的增长，照着我们的尺度，因着你们得以丰盛的扩大， ###EN### We are not boasting beyond our measure in others' labors, but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance,
Verse_Ch: 10:16 将福音传到你们以外的地方，并不是在别人的尺度之内，凭现成的事夸口。 ###EN### So that we may announce the gospel unto those parts beyond you, not so that we may boast in another man's rule in things already prepared.
Verse_Ch: 10:17 但夸口的当在主里夸口， ###EN### But he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord;
Verse_Ch: 10:18 因为蒙称许的，不是自己推荐的，乃是主所推荐的。 ###EN### For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
Chapter_Header: 11
Verse_Ch: 11:1 我愿你们容忍我一点愚妄，其实你们确是容忍我的。 ###EN### I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you do bear with me.
Verse_Ch: 11:2 我以神的妒忌，妒忌你们，因为我曾把你们许配一个丈夫，要将一个贞洁的童女献给基督。 ###EN### For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
Verse_Ch: 11:3 我只怕你们的心思或被败坏，失去那向着基督的单纯和纯洁，就像蛇用诡诈诱骗了夏娃一样。 ###EN### But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ.
Verse_Ch: 11:4 假若有人来，传另一位耶稣，不是我们所传过的，或者你们接受了一个不同的灵，不是你们所接受过的，或者接受了一个不同的福音，不是你们所接 受过的，你们还好好的容忍他！ ###EN### For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit, which you have not received, or a different gospel, which you have not accepted, you bear well with him.
Verse_Ch: 11:5 但我认为，自己一点没有赶不上那些超级的使徒。 ###EN### But I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing.
Verse_Ch: 11:6 我即使在言语上是常人，在知识上却不然；其实我们在凡事上，在各方面，都已经向你们显明了。 ###EN### But even if I am a layman in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; indeed in every way we have made this manifest in all things to you.
Verse_Ch: 11:7 我因为白白传神的福音给你们，就卑屈自己，为叫你们升高，这是我犯了罪么？ ###EN### Or did I commit a sin, abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I announced the gospel of God to you free of charge?
Verse_Ch: 11:8 我剥夺了别的召会，取了工价，为着服事你们。 ###EN### I robbed other churches, taking wages for the ministry to you.
Verse_Ch: 11:9 我在你们那里缺乏的时候，并没有累着你们一个人，因我所缺乏的，那从马其顿来的弟兄们都补足了。我向来凡事自守，不累着你们，将来也必自守。 ###EN### And when I was present with you and lacked, I was not a burden to anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia filled up my lack, and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will keep myself.
Verse_Ch: 11:10 基督的真实在我里面，这夸口在亚该亚一带，是不会在我身上被堵住的。 ###EN### The truthfulness of Christ is in me, that this boasting shall not be stopped as it regards me in the regions of Achaia.
Verse_Ch: 11:11 为什么？是因我不爱你们么？神晓得。 ###EN### Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.
Verse_Ch: 11:12 我现在所作的，将来还要作，为要断绝那些要得机会者的机会，使他们在所夸的事上，给人看出也不过与我们一样。 ###EN### But what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity, that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we.
Verse_Ch: 11:13 那等人是假使徒，是诡诈的工人，装作基督的使徒。 ###EN### For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.
Verse_Ch: 11:14 这并不希奇，因为撒但自己也装作光的使者。 ###EN### And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light.
Verse_Ch: 11:15 所以他的差役若也装作义的差役，并不算大事，他们的结局，必然照着他们所作的。 ###EN### Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
Verse_Ch: 11:16 我再说，人不可把我看作愚妄的；纵然如此，也要把我当作愚妄人接纳，叫我也可以略略夸口。 ###EN### Again I say, Let no one think me to be foolish; but if otherwise, accept me even as if I were foolish, that I also may boast a little.
Verse_Ch: 11:17 我所说的，不是照着主说的，乃像在愚妄中，因自信而这样夸口。 ###EN### What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord but as if in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
Verse_Ch: 11:18 既有好些人照着肉体夸口，我也要夸口， ###EN### Since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.
Verse_Ch: 11:19 因你们是精明人，喜欢容忍愚妄人。 ###EN### For you bear gladly with fools because you yourselves are wise.
Verse_Ch: 11:20 若有人强制你们作奴隶，若有人侵吞你们，若有人掳掠你们，若有人高举自己，若有人打你们的脸，你们都会容忍！ ###EN### For you bear it if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes you, if anyone lifts himself up, if anyone beats you in the face.
Verse_Ch: 11:21 我自贱的说，我们从前太软弱了！然而，我愚妄的说，人在何事上勇敢，我也勇敢。 ###EN### By way of self-disparagement I say this, Supposedly we ourselves were weak. But in whatever anyone else is daring, I speak in foolishness, I also am daring.
Verse_Ch: 11:22 他们是希伯来人么？我也是。他们是以色列人么？我也是。他们是亚伯拉罕的后裔么？我也是。 ###EN### Hebrews are they? I also. Israelites are they? I also. The seed of Abraham are they? I also.
Verse_Ch: 11:23 他们是基督的执事么？我疯狂的说，我更是！论劳苦，是更多的；论下监，是更多的；论鞭打，是过重的；论冒死，是屡次有的。 ###EN### Ministers of Christ are they? I speak as being beside myself, I more so! In labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, in deaths often.
Verse_Ch: 11:24 我给犹太人鞭打五次，每次四十，减去一下； ###EN### Under the hands of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one;
Verse_Ch: 11:25 给棍打了三次，给石头打了一次，遇着船坏三次，在深海里过了一昼一夜； ###EN### Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep;

Chapter_Header: 12
Verse_Ch: 12:1 夸口固然无益，但我是不得已的。我要来说主的异象和启示。 ###EN### To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient; yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
Verse_Ch: 12:2 我认得一个在基督里的人，十四年前，这样的一位被提，直到第三层天里，（或在身内，我不晓得，或在身外，我也不晓得，只有神晓得。） ###EN### I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows) such a one was caught away to the third heaven.

Verse_Ch: 12:9 祂对我说，我的恩典够你用的，因为我的能力，是在人的软弱上显得完全。所以我极其喜欢夸我的软弱，好叫基督的能力覆庇我。 ###EN### And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.

Verse_Ch: 12:14 看哪，这是我第三次预备好，要到你们那里去，也必不累着你们，因我所寻求的不是你们的东西，乃是你们自己。因为儿女不该为父母积蓄，父母 乃该为儿女积蓄。 ###EN### Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden; for I do not seek what is yours but you.

Verse_Ch: 12:19 你们一向以为我们是向你们分诉，我们乃是在基督里当着神面前说话。亲爱的，一切的事都是为建造你们。 ###EN### All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Before God in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, are for your building up.
Verse_Ch: 12:20 我怕我来的时候，或许见到你们不合我所想要的，你们见到我也不合你们所想要的；又怕有争竞、嫉妒、恼怒、私图好争、诽谤、谗言、自高自大、 混乱的事； ###EN### For I fear that perhaps when I come, I may find you not such as I wish, and I may be found by you not such as you wish; that perhaps there may be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, slanders, whisperings, demonstrations of being puffed up, tumults;

Verse_Ch: 13:4 祂固然由于软弱被钉十字架，却由于神的大能仍然活着。我们在祂里面也是软弱，但由于神向着你们的大能，必与祂同活。 ###EN### For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God. For indeed we are weak in Him, but we will live together with Him by the power of God directed toward you.
