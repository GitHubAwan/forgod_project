Verse_Ch: 1:3 约拿却起来，逃往他施去躲避耶和华的面；他下到约帕，遇见一只船，要往他施去。他就给了船价，下到船里，要与船上的人同往他施去，躲避耶和 华的面。 ###EN### But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah, and he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish.

Verse_Ch: 1:11 他们问他说，我们当向你怎样行，使海为我们平静下来呢？这是因为海越发翻腾。 ###EN### And they said to him, What shall we do with you that the sea may be quiet for us? For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.

Verse_Ch: 1:13 然而那些人竭力摇桨，要回到旱地，却是不能，因为海越发向他们翻腾。 ###EN### Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get back to the dry land, but they could not, because the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
Verse_Ch: 1:14 他们便呼求耶和华说，耶和华阿，我们恳求你，不要因这人的性命使我们灭亡；不要使流无辜血的罪归与我们；因为你耶和华是照自己所喜悦的行事。 ###EN### And they cried out to Jehovah and said, Ah, Jehovah, let us not perish, we pray, for this man's life, and do not put innocent blood upon us; for You, Jehovah, have done as You pleased.

Verse_Ch: 2:3 你将我投下深渊，到了海心；洪流环绕我；你的波浪洪涛，都漫过我身。 ###EN### You flung me into the depths, into the heart of the sea, And the flood surrounded me; All Your breakers and Your billows Passed over me.

Verse_Ch: 4:2 他就祷告耶和华说，耶和华阿，我在本地的时候，岂不是这样说么？我知道你是有恩典、有怜恤的神，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱，并且后悔不降所 说的灾，所以我急速逃往他施去。 ###EN### And he prayed to Jehovah and said, Ah, Jehovah, was this not what I said when I was still in my land? Therefore I anticipated it by fleeing to Tarshish, for I know that You are a gracious and compassionate God, long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness and repentant of evil.

Verse_Ch: 4:4 耶和华说，你这样发怒合理么？ ###EN### And Jehovah said, Do you do well to be angry?
Verse_Ch: 4:5 于是约拿出城，坐在城的东边。他在那里为自己搭了一座棚，坐在棚的荫下，要看看那城究竟如何。 ###EN### Then Jonah went out from the city and sat to the east of the city. And he made a booth for himself there and sat underneath it in the shade until he could see what would happen to the city.

Verse_Ch: 4:8 日头出来的时候，神安排炎热的东风。日头曝晒约拿的头，他就发昏。他为自己求死，说，我死了比活着还好。 ###EN### And when the sun rose, God prepared a sultry east wind. And the sun beat down on Jonah's head, and he fainted. And he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
Verse_Ch: 4:9 神对约拿说，你因这棵蓖麻发怒合理么？他说，我发怒以至于死，都是合理的。 ###EN### And God said to Jonah, Do you do well to be angry about the tree? And he said, I do well to be angry unto death.
Verse_Ch: 4:10 耶和华说，这蓖麻不是你劳苦栽种的，也不是你使它长大的；一夜生长，一夜枯死，你尚且怜惜； ###EN### And Jehovah said, You had pity on the tree that you did not labor for nor cause to grow, which came into being overnight and perished overnight;
Verse_Ch: 4:11 何况这尼尼微大城，其中不能分辨右手和左手的有十二万多人，并有许多牲畜，我岂能不怜惜呢？ ###EN### And I, should I not have pity on Nineveh, the great city, in which are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot discern between their right hand and their left, and many cattle?
