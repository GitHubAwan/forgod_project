Verse_Ch: 4:23 时候将到，如今就是了，那真正敬拜父的，要在灵和真实里敬拜祂，因为父寻找这样敬拜祂的人。 ###EN### But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him.

Verse_Ch: 4:26 耶稣说，这和你说话的就是祂。 ###EN### Jesus said to her, I, who speak to you, am He.
Verse_Ch: 4:27 正在这时候，耶稣的门徒回来，就希奇祂同一个妇人说话；只是没有人说，你寻求什么？或说，你为什么同她说话？ ###EN### And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking? or, Why are You speaking with her?
Verse_Ch: 4:28 那妇人就留下她的水罐子，往城里去，对众人说， ###EN### Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people,
Verse_Ch: 4:29 你们来看，有一个人将我素来所行的一切事，都给我说出来了，这岂不就是基督么？ ###EN### Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?

Verse_Ch: 4:31 这其间，门徒求耶稣说，拉比，请吃。 ###EN### In the meantime, the disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
Verse_Ch: 4:32 祂对他们说，我有食物吃，是你们不知道的。 ###EN### But He said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about.
Verse_Ch: 4:33 门徒就彼此说，莫非有人拿什么给祂吃了？ ###EN### The disciples therefore said to one another, Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?
Verse_Ch: 4:34 耶稣说，我的食物就是实行差我来者的旨意，作成祂的工。 ###EN### Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.

Verse_Ch: 4:36 收割的人得工价，收积五谷归入永远的生命，叫撒种的和收割的一同欢乐。 ###EN### He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
Verse_Ch: 4:37 那人撒种，这人收割，这话可见是真的。 ###EN### For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.
Verse_Ch: 4:38 我差你们去收你们所没有劳苦的，别人劳苦，你们享受他们所劳苦的。 ###EN### I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.
Verse_Ch: 4:39 那城里有好些撒玛利亚人信入了耶稣，因为那妇人作见证说，祂将我素来所行的一切事，都给我说出来了。 ###EN### And many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all that I have done.
Verse_Ch: 4:40 于是撒玛利亚人来到耶稣跟前，求祂同他们住下，祂便在那里住了两天。 ###EN### So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them, and He remained there two days.
Verse_Ch: 4:41 因耶稣的话，信的人就更多了。 ###EN### And many more believed because of His word.

Verse_Ch: 4:43 过了那两天，耶稣就离开那里，往加利利去。 ###EN### And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee,
Verse_Ch: 4:44 因为耶稣自己作过见证说，申言者在本地是不受尊敬的。 ###EN### For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
Verse_Ch: 4:45 到了加利利，加利利人因为看见祂在耶路撒冷过节时所行的一切事，就接待祂，因为他们也曾上去过节。 ###EN### Then when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.
Verse_Ch: 4:46 耶稣又到了加利利的迦拿，就是祂从前变水为酒的地方。有一个大臣，他的儿子在迦百农患病。 ###EN### He then came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick in Capernaum.

Verse_Ch: 4:48 耶稣就对他说，若不看见神迹奇事，你们总是不信。 ###EN### Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.
Verse_Ch: 4:49 那大臣对祂说，先生，求你趁着我的孩子还没有死，就下去。 ###EN### The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my little child dies.
Verse_Ch: 4:50 耶稣对他说，去吧，你的儿子活了。那人信耶稣对他所说的话，就去了。 ###EN### Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way.
Verse_Ch: 4:51 正下去的时候，他的奴仆迎见他，说他的孩子活了。 ###EN### And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and said that his child was living.
Verse_Ch: 4:52 他就向他们查问，孩子是什么时候见好的。他们说，昨天午后七时，烧就退了。 ###EN### So he asked them the hour in which he got better. They said then to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

Chapter_Header: 5
Verse_Ch: 5:1 这事以后，到了犹太人的一个节期，耶稣就上耶路撒冷去。 ###EN### After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
Verse_Ch: 5:2 在耶路撒冷靠近羊门有一个池子，希伯来话叫作毕士大，旁边有五个廊子。 ###EN### Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.
Verse_Ch: 5:3 里面躺着许多病弱的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的、枯干的，等候水动。 ###EN### In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
Verse_Ch: 5:4 因为有天使时常下池子搅动那水，水动之后，谁先下去，无论患什么病，都会痊愈。 ###EN### For an angel went down from time to time in the pool and stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was being held by.
Verse_Ch: 5:5 在那里有一个人，病了三十八年。 ###EN### And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.
Verse_Ch: 5:6 耶稣看见他躺着，知道他已经病了许久，就问他说，你想要痊愈么？ ###EN### When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to get well?
Verse_Ch: 5:7 病人回答说，先生，水动的时候，没有人把我放在池子里；我正去的时候，总有别人比我先下去。 ###EN### The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.
Verse_Ch: 5:8 耶稣对他说，起来，拿你的褥子走吧。 ###EN### Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat and walk.
Verse_Ch: 5:9 那人立即痊愈，就拿起褥子走了。 ###EN### And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day;
Verse_Ch: 5:10 那天是安息日，所以犹太人对那治好的人说，今天是安息日，你拿褥子是不可的。 ###EN### Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat.
Verse_Ch: 5:11 他却回答说，那使我痊愈的对我说，拿你的褥子走吧。 ###EN### But he answered them, He who made me well, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk.
Verse_Ch: 5:12 他们问他说，那对你说拿褥子走的人是谁？ ###EN### They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your mat and walk?
Verse_Ch: 5:13 那治好的人不知道是谁，因为那地方人多，耶稣已经退避了。 ###EN### But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, there being a crowd in that place.
Verse_Ch: 5:14 这事以后，耶稣在殿里遇见他，对他说，看哪，你已经痊愈了，不要再犯罪，恐怕你遭遇的更加厉害。 ###EN### After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you.
Verse_Ch: 5:15 那人就去告诉犹太人，使他痊愈的是耶稣。 ###EN### The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the One who made him well.
Verse_Ch: 5:16 所以犹太人逼迫耶稣，想要杀祂，因为祂在安息日作了这事。 ###EN### And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath.
Verse_Ch: 5:17 耶稣就对他们说，我父作工直到如今，我也作工。 ###EN### But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working.
Verse_Ch: 5:18 所以犹太人就越发想要杀祂，因祂不但犯了安息日，并且称神为祂的父，将自己与神当作平等。 ###EN### Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
Verse_Ch: 5:19 耶稣对他们说，我实实在在的告诉你们，子从自己不能作什么，惟有看见父所作的，子才能作；父所作的事，子也照样作。 ###EN### Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
Verse_Ch: 5:20 父爱子，将自己所作的一切事指示祂，还要将比这更大的事指示祂，叫你们希奇。 ###EN### For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and greater works than these He will show Him that you may marvel.
Verse_Ch: 5:21 父怎样叫死人起来，赐他们生命，子也照样随自己的意思赐人生命。 ###EN### For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills.
Verse_Ch: 5:22 父也不审判什么人，乃将审判的事全交与子， ###EN### For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,
Verse_Ch: 5:23 叫人都尊敬子，如同尊敬父一样。不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差子来的父。 ###EN### In order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
Verse_Ch: 5:24 我实实在在的告诉你们，那听我话，又信差我来者的，就有永远的生命，不至于受审判，乃是已经出死入生了。 ###EN### Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life.
Verse_Ch: 5:25 我实实在在的告诉你们，时候将到，如今就是了，死人要听见神儿子的声音，听见的人就要活了。 ###EN### Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
Verse_Ch: 5:26 因为父怎样在自己里面有生命，就赐给子也照样在自己里面有生命； ###EN### For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself;
Verse_Ch: 5:27 并且因为祂是人子，就赐给祂行审判的权柄。 ###EN### And He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man.
Verse_Ch: 5:28 你们不要把这事看作希奇，因为时候将到，凡在坟墓里的，都要听见祂的声音，就出来； ###EN### Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice
Verse_Ch: 5:29 行善的归到生命的复活，作恶的归到审判的复活。 ###EN### And will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
Verse_Ch: 5:30 我从自己不能作什么；我怎么听见，就怎么审判；我的审判也是公平的，因为我不寻求自己的意思，只寻求那差我来者的意思。 ###EN### I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.
Verse_Ch: 5:31 我若为自己作见证，我的见证就不真。 ###EN### If I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.
Verse_Ch: 5:32 另有一位为我作见证，我也知道他为我作的见证是真的。 ###EN### There is another who testifies concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning Me is true.
Verse_Ch: 5:33 你们曾差人到约翰那里，他为真理作过见证。 ###EN### You have sent people to John, and he has testified to the truth.
Verse_Ch: 5:34 其实我不接受从人来的见证；然而我说这些话，为要叫你们得救。 ###EN### But it is not from man that I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved.
Verse_Ch: 5:35 约翰是点着且发亮的灯，你们情愿暂时在他的光中欢腾。 ###EN### He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light.
Verse_Ch: 5:36 但我有比约翰更大的见证，因为父交给我要我完成的工，就是我所作的这些工，为我作见证，我是父所差来的。 ###EN### But I have the testimony which is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me.
Verse_Ch: 5:37 差我来的父，也为我作过见证。你们从来没有听过祂的声音，也没有见过祂的形状， ###EN### And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form,
Verse_Ch: 5:38 并且你们没有祂的话住在你们里面，因为祂所差来的这一位，你们不信。 ###EN### And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe.
Verse_Ch: 5:39 你们查考圣经，因你们以为其中有永远的生命，为我作见证的就是这经。 ###EN### You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me.
Verse_Ch: 5:40 然而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。 ###EN### Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
Verse_Ch: 5:41 我不接受从人来的荣耀。 ###EN### I do not receive glory from men.
Verse_Ch: 5:42 但我认识你们，知道你们里面没有神的爱。 ###EN### But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.
Verse_Ch: 5:43 我在我父的名里来，你们并不接受我；若有别人在自己的名里来，你们倒要接受他。 ###EN### I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
Verse_Ch: 5:44 你们互相受荣耀，却不寻求从独一之神来的荣耀，怎能信我呢？ ###EN### How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?
Verse_Ch: 5:45 不要以为我要向父控告你们；有一位控告你们的，就是你们所仰赖的摩西。 ###EN### Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have set your hope.
Verse_Ch: 5:46 你们若信摩西，也必信我，因为他曾写过关于我的事。 ###EN### For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me.
Verse_Ch: 5:47 你们若不信他所写的，怎能信我的话？ ###EN### But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?

Verse_Ch: 6:3 耶稣上了山，和门徒一同坐在那里。 ###EN### And Jesus went up to the mountain and sat there with His disciples.
Verse_Ch: 6:4 那时犹太人的逾越节近了。 ###EN### Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
Verse_Ch: 6:5 耶稣举目看见大批群众向祂走来，就对腓力说，我们从那里买饼给这些人吃？ ###EN### Jesus then lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd was coming toward Him, said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread that these may eat?
Verse_Ch: 6:6 祂说这话，是要试验腓力，祂自己原知道要怎样行。 ###EN### But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.
Verse_Ch: 6:7 腓力回答说，就是二百银币的饼，叫他们各人吃一点，也是不够的。 ###EN### Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little.
Verse_Ch: 6:8 有一个门徒，就是西门彼得的兄弟安得烈，对耶稣说， ###EN### One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,
Verse_Ch: 6:9 这里有一个孩童，他有五个大麦饼、两条鱼，只是供给这么多人，还算什么？ ###EN### There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many?
Verse_Ch: 6:10 耶稣说，你们叫众人坐下。原来那地方的草多。坐下的男人，数目约有五千。 ###EN### Jesus said, Have the people recline. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.
Verse_Ch: 6:11 耶稣拿起饼来，祝谢了，就分给那坐着的人，分鱼也是这样，都随着他们所要的。 ###EN### Jesus then took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.
Verse_Ch: 6:12 他们吃饱了，耶稣对门徒说，把剩下的零碎收拾起来，免得有蹧蹋的。 ###EN### And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost.
Verse_Ch: 6:13 他们便将那五个大麦饼的零碎，就是众人吃了剩下的，收拾起来，装满了十二篮子。 ###EN### So they gathered them and filled twelve handbaskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over among those who had eaten.
Verse_Ch: 6:14 众人看见耶稣所行的神迹，就说，这真是那要到世上来的申言者。 ###EN### The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.

Verse_Ch: 6:18 因为起了大风，海就翻腾起来。 ###EN### And because a strong wind was blowing, the sea was churning.
Verse_Ch: 6:19 门徒摇橹约行了五、六公里，看见耶稣在海上行走，渐渐近了船，他们就害怕。 ###EN### Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they became frightened.
Verse_Ch: 6:20 耶稣对他们说，是我，不要怕。 ###EN### But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.
Verse_Ch: 6:21 门徒这才乐意接祂上船，船立刻到了他们所要去的地方。 ###EN### Then they were willing to take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
Verse_Ch: 6:22 第二日，站在海那边的群众，看见那里除了一只小船以外，没有别的船，又知道耶稣没有同祂的门徒上船，乃是门徒自己去的。 ###EN### The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone.
Verse_Ch: 6:23 另有几只小船从提比哩亚来，靠近主祝谢后，众人吃饼的地方。 ###EN### But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
Verse_Ch: 6:24 群众见耶稣和祂的门徒都不在那里，就上了小船，往迦百农去找耶稣。 ###EN### So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
Verse_Ch: 6:25 他们既在海那边找着了，就对祂说，拉比，你是几时到这里来的？ ###EN### And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here?
Verse_Ch: 6:26 耶稣回答说，我实实在在的告诉你们，你们找我，并不是因看见神迹，乃是因吃饼得饱。 ###EN### Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.
Verse_Ch: 6:27 不要为那必坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永远生命的食物劳力，就是人子要赐给你们的，因为祂是父神所印证的。 ###EN### Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed.
Verse_Ch: 6:28 他们问祂说，我们当怎样行，才算作神的工？ ###EN### Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?
Verse_Ch: 6:29 耶稣回答说，信入神所差来的，这就是作神的工。 ###EN### Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent.
Verse_Ch: 6:30 他们就说，这样，你行什么神迹，叫我们看见就信你？你到底作什么工？ ###EN### They said then to Him, What sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do?
Verse_Ch: 6:31 我们的祖宗在旷野吃过吗哪，如经上所记：“祂把那从天上来的粮赐给他们吃。” ###EN### Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, "He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.''
Verse_Ch: 6:32 耶稣说，我实实在在的告诉你们，不是摩西把那从天上来的粮赐给你们，乃是我父把那从天上来的真粮赐给你们。 ###EN### Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
Verse_Ch: 6:33 因为神的粮，就是那从天上降下来赐生命给世人的。 ###EN### For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.
Verse_Ch: 6:34 他们对祂说，主阿，常将这粮赐给我们。 ###EN### They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.

Verse_Ch: 6:38 因为我从天上降下来，不是要行我自己的意思，乃是要行那差我来者的意思。 ###EN### For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.
Verse_Ch: 6:39 那差我来者的意思，就是凡祂所赐给我的，叫我一个也不失落，在末日却叫他复活。 ###EN### And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up in the last day.
Verse_Ch: 6:40 因为我父的意思，是叫一切看见子而信入祂的人，得着永远的生命，并且在末日我要叫他复活。 ###EN### For this is the will of My Father, that every one who beholds the Son and believes into Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.
Verse_Ch: 6:41 犹太人因为耶稣说，我是从天上降下来的粮，就唧咕议论祂。 ###EN### The Jews therefore murmured concerning Him because He said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.
Verse_Ch: 6:42 他们说，这不是约瑟的儿子耶稣么？祂的父母我们岂不认得么？祂如今怎么说，我是从天上降下来的？ ###EN### And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, I have come down out of heaven?
Verse_Ch: 6:43 耶稣回答说，你们不要彼此唧咕议论。 ###EN### Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.
Verse_Ch: 6:44 若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有人能到我这里来；到我这里来的，在末日我要叫他复活。 ###EN### No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up in the last day.
Verse_Ch: 6:45 申言者书上记着，“他们都要蒙神的教导。”凡从父听见又学习的，就到我这里来。 ###EN### It is written in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught of God.'' Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.
Verse_Ch: 6:46 这不是说，有人看见过父，惟独从神来的，祂看见过父。 ###EN### Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.
Verse_Ch: 6:47 我实实在在的告诉你们，信的人有永远的生命。 ###EN### Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes has eternal life.
Verse_Ch: 6:48 我就是生命的粮。 ###EN### I am the bread of life.
Verse_Ch: 6:49 你们的祖宗在旷野吃过吗哪，还是死了。 ###EN### Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
Verse_Ch: 6:50 这是从天上降下来的粮，叫人吃了就不死。 ###EN### This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.

Verse_Ch: 7:22 摩西传割礼给你们，（其实不是从摩西开始的，乃是从祖先开始的，）因此你们也在安息日给人行割礼。 ###EN### For the same reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.

Verse_Ch: 7:38 信入我的人，就如经上所说，从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。 ###EN### He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.
Verse_Ch: 7:39 耶稣这话是指着信入祂的人将要受的那灵说的；那时还没有那灵，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。 ###EN### But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
Verse_Ch: 7:40 群众听见这话，有的说，这真是那申言者。 ###EN### Some of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the Prophet.

Verse_Ch: 7:47 法利赛人回答他们说，你们也受了迷惑么？ ###EN### The Pharisees then answered them, Have you also been deceived?
Verse_Ch: 7:48 官长或是法利赛人，岂有信入祂的？ ###EN### Has any one of the rulers or Pharisees believed into Him?
Verse_Ch: 7:49 但这不明白律法的群众，是被咒诅的。 ###EN### But this crowd which does not know the law is accursed.
Verse_Ch: 7:50 他们当中有尼哥底母，就是先前到耶稣那里去的，对他们说， ###EN### Nicodemus said to them (he who came to Him before, being one of them),
Verse_Ch: 7:51 若不先听本人的口供，不知道他所作的事，难道我们的律法就定他的罪么？ ###EN### Does our law condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing?
Verse_Ch: 7:52 他们回答他说，难道你也是出于加利利么？你且去查考，就知道没有申言者是出于加利利而兴起的。于是各人都回自己的家去了。 ###EN### They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.

Verse_Ch: 8:5 摩西在律法上吩咐我们，把这样的妇人用石头打死，这样，你怎么说？ ###EN### Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do you say?
Verse_Ch: 8:6 他们说这话，是要试诱耶稣，好得着把柄告祂。耶稣却弯下腰来，用指头在地上写字。 ###EN### But they said this to tempt Him, so that they might have reason to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground.
Verse_Ch: 8:7 他们还是不住的问祂，耶稣就直起腰来，对他们说，你们中间谁是没有罪的，谁就先拿石头打她。 ###EN### But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.
Verse_Ch: 8:8 于是又弯下腰来，在地上写字。 ###EN### And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
Verse_Ch: 8:9 他们听见了，就从老的开始，一个一个的出去了；只剩下耶稣一人，还有那妇人仍然站在当中。 ###EN### And when they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood where she was, in the midst.
Verse_Ch: 8:10 耶稣就直起腰来，对她说，妇人，那些人在那里？没有人定你的罪么？ ###EN### And Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?
Verse_Ch: 8:11 她说，主阿，没有。耶稣说，我也不定你的罪；去吧，从今以后不要再犯罪了。 ###EN### And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.

Verse_Ch: 8:13 法利赛人就对祂说，你是为自己作见证，你的见证不真。 ###EN### The Pharisees then said to Him, You are testifying concerning Yourself; Your testimony is not true.
Verse_Ch: 8:14 耶稣回答他们说，我就是为自己作见证，我的见证还是真的，因我晓得我从那里来，往那里去，你们却不晓得我从那里来，往那里去。 ###EN### Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
Verse_Ch: 8:15 你们是凭肉体判断人，我不判断任何人。 ###EN### You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
Verse_Ch: 8:16 我就是判断，我的判断也是真的，因为我并不单独，还有差我来的父与我同在。 ###EN### But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.
Verse_Ch: 8:17 连你们的律法上也记着，两个人的见证是真的： ###EN### And in your law also it has been written that the testimony of two men is true:

Verse_Ch: 8:20 这些话是耶稣在殿里施教的时候，在银库那里说的，也没有人拿祂，因为祂的时候还没有到。 ###EN### These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.
Verse_Ch: 8:21 耶稣又对他们说，我要去了，你们要寻找我，并且你们要死在你们的罪中；我所去的地方，你们不能到。 ###EN### He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.
Verse_Ch: 8:22 犹太人就说，祂说我所去的地方，你们不能到，难道祂要自杀么？ ###EN### The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?
Verse_Ch: 8:23 耶稣对他们说，你们是出于下头的，我是出于上头的；你们是属这世界的，我不是属这世界的。 ###EN### And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.

Verse_Ch: 8:26 关于你们，我有许多事要讲说，要判断；但那差我来的是真实的，我把从祂所听见的这些事，对世人讲说。 ###EN### I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.
Verse_Ch: 8:27 他们不明白耶稣是在对他们讲说父。 ###EN### They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.
Verse_Ch: 8:28 所以耶稣对他们说，你们举起人子以后，必知道我是，并且知道我不从自己作什么；我说这些话，乃是照着父所教训我的。 ###EN### Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.
Verse_Ch: 8:29 那差我来的是与我同在，祂没有撇下我独自一人，因为我始终作祂所喜悦的事。 ###EN### And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.
Verse_Ch: 8:30 耶稣说这些话的时候，就有许多人信入了祂。 ###EN### As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.
Verse_Ch: 8:31 耶稣对信祂的犹太人说，你们若住在我的话里，就真是我的门徒； ###EN### Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples;
Verse_Ch: 8:32 你们必认识真理，真理必叫你们得以自由。 ###EN### And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.
Verse_Ch: 8:33 他们回答祂说，我们是亚伯拉罕的后裔，从来没有被谁奴役过；你怎么说，你们必得以自由？ ###EN### They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that You say, You shall become free?
Verse_Ch: 8:34 耶稣回答他们说，我实实在在的告诉你们，凡犯罪的，就是罪的奴仆。 ###EN### Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
Verse_Ch: 8:35 奴仆不永远住在家里，儿子是永远住在家里。 ###EN### And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever.
Verse_Ch: 8:36 所以神的儿子若叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。 ###EN### If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.
Verse_Ch: 8:37 我知道你们是亚伯拉罕的后裔；你们却想要杀我，因为你们里面容不下我的话。 ###EN### I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.
Verse_Ch: 8:38 我所说的，是在我父那里看见的；你们所行的，是从你们的父听见的。 ###EN### I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father.
Verse_Ch: 8:39 他们回答祂说，我们的父就是亚伯拉罕。耶稣对他们说，你们若是亚伯拉罕的子孙，就必行亚伯拉罕所作的。 ###EN### They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.

Verse_Ch: 8:41 你们是行你们父所作的。他们对祂说，我们不是从淫乱生的；我们只有一位父，就是神。 ###EN### You do the works of your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.
Verse_Ch: 8:42 耶稣对他们说，倘若神是你们的父，你们就必爱我；因为我是出于神而前来的，并且已经来了。我不是从自己来的，乃是祂差了我来。 ###EN### Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come from Him; for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me.
Verse_Ch: 8:43 你们为什么不明白我的讲说？无非是因你们不能听我的话。 ###EN### Why do you not understand My speaking? It is because you cannot hear My word.
Verse_Ch: 8:44 你们是出于那父魔鬼，你们父的私欲，你们愿意行。他从起初就是杀人的，并且不站在真理中，因为在他里面没有真理。他说谎是出于他自己的私有 物，因他是说谎的，也是说谎者的父。 ###EN### You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.

Verse_Ch: 8:50 然而我不寻求自己的荣耀，有一位为我寻求荣耀并审判人的。 ###EN### But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks glory for Me and judges.
Verse_Ch: 8:51 我实实在在的告诉你们，人若遵守我的话，必永远不见死。 ###EN### Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever.
Verse_Ch: 8:52 犹太人对祂说，现在我们知道你有鬼附着。亚伯拉罕死了，众申言者也死了，你还说人若遵守我的话，必永远不尝死味。 ###EN### The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets too; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever.

Verse_Ch: 8:54 耶稣回答说，我若荣耀自己，我的荣耀就算不得什么，荣耀我的乃是我的父，就是你们所说是你们神的那一位。 ###EN### Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.
Verse_Ch: 8:55 你们未曾认识祂，我却认识祂。我若说不认识祂，我就是说谎的，像你们一样，但我认识祂，也遵守祂的话。 ###EN### Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word.
Verse_Ch: 8:56 你们的祖宗亚伯拉罕欢腾的要见我的日子，既看见了，就欢乐。 ###EN### Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced.

Verse_Ch: 9:16 法利赛人中有的说，这个人不是从神来的，因为祂不守安息日。又有的说，一个罪人怎能行这样的神迹？他们中间就起了分裂。 ###EN### Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.
Verse_Ch: 9:17 他们又对瞎子说，祂既然开了你的眼睛，你说祂是怎样的人？他说，是个申言者。 ###EN### Then they said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him, in that He opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.

Verse_Ch: 9:22 他父母说这话，是因怕犹太人，因为犹太人已经商议定了，若有承认耶稣是基督的，要把他赶出会堂。 ###EN### His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
Verse_Ch: 9:23 因此他父母说，他已经成人了，你们问他吧。 ###EN### Because of this his parents said, He is of age; question him.

Verse_Ch: 9:28 他们就骂他说，你是那人的门徒，我们是摩西的门徒。 ###EN### And they reviled him and said, You are His disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.
Verse_Ch: 9:29 我们晓得神曾对摩西说过话，只是这个人，我们不晓得祂是那里的。 ###EN### We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.
Verse_Ch: 9:30 那人回答说，祂开了我的眼睛，你们竟不晓得祂是那里的，这真是奇怪。 ###EN### The man answered and said to them, Why here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes!

Verse_Ch: 9:35 耶稣听说他们把他赶出去，后来遇见他，就说，你信入神的儿子么？ ###EN### Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and He found him and said, Do you believe into the Son of God?
Verse_Ch: 9:36 他回答说，主阿，谁是神的儿子，叫我信入祂？ ###EN### He answered and said, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?

Verse_Ch: 9:40 同祂在那里的法利赛人，有的听见这话，就说，难道我们也瞎了眼么？ ###EN### Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not blind also, are we?
