Verse_Ch: 13:9 有耳可听的，就应当听。 ###EN### He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Verse_Ch: 13:10 门徒进前来，对祂说，你对众人讲话，为什么用比喻？ ###EN### And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them?
Verse_Ch: 13:11 祂回答说，因为诸天之国的奥秘，只给你们知道，不给他们知道。 ###EN### And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.
Verse_Ch: 13:12 因为凡有的，还要给他，他就充盈有余；凡没有的，连他所有的，也要从他夺去。 ###EN### For whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.

Verse_Ch: 13:17 我实在告诉你们，曾经有许多申言者和义人，渴想要看你们所看的，却没有看见；要听你们所听的，却没有听见。 ###EN### For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.
Verse_Ch: 13:18 所以你们要听这撒种者的比喻。 ###EN### You therefore hear the parable of the one who sowed.

Verse_Ch: 13:21 只因他里面没有根，不过是暂时的；一旦为道遭遇患难或逼迫，就立刻绊跌了。 ###EN### Yet he does not have root in himself but lasts only for a time, and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately he is stumbled.
Verse_Ch: 13:22 还有那撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，后来有今世的思虑，和钱财的迷惑，把道全然挤住了，道就不能结实。 ###EN### And the one sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Verse_Ch: 13:23 但那撒在好土里的，就是人听了道，也领悟了，他就结出果实，有的结了一百倍，有的六十倍，有的三十倍。 ###EN### But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.
Verse_Ch: 13:24 耶稣在他们跟前另设一个比喻，说，诸天的国好比人撒好种在他的田里； ###EN### Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field.
Verse_Ch: 13:25 及至人们睡觉的时候，他的仇敌来了，将稗子撒在麦子中间，就走了。 ###EN### But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.

Verse_Ch: 13:28 他就对他们说，这是仇敌作的。奴仆就对他说，那么你要我们去薅集它们么？ ###EN### And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them?
Verse_Ch: 13:29 他就说，不，免得薅集稗子，连麦子也一齐带根薅出来。 ###EN### But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.
Verse_Ch: 13:30 让这两样一齐长，直到收割。在收割的时候，我要对收割的人说，先薅集稗子，捆成捆，好把它们烧了，麦子却要收到我的仓里。 ###EN### Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn.
Verse_Ch: 13:31 耶稣在他们跟前另设一个比喻，说，诸天的国好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在他的田里。 ###EN### Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,
Verse_Ch: 13:32 这乃是百种里最小的，但长起来，却比别的菜都大，且成了树，甚至天空的飞鸟来栖宿在它的枝上。 ###EN### And which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.

Verse_Ch: 13:34 耶稣用比喻对群众讲说这一切的事，若不用比喻，就不对他们说什么。 ###EN### All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and apart from a parable He spoke nothing to them,
Verse_Ch: 13:35 这是要应验那借着申言者所说的，说，“我要开口用比喻，把创世以来所隐藏的事说出来。” ###EN### So that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.''
Verse_Ch: 13:36 当下，耶稣离开群众，进了屋里，祂的门徒到祂跟前来，说，请把田间稗子的比喻，给我们讲解清楚。 ###EN### Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us.
Verse_Ch: 13:37 祂就回答说，那撒好种的就是人子， ###EN### And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;
Verse_Ch: 13:38 田地就是世界，好种就是国度之子，稗子就是恶者之子， ###EN### And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;
Verse_Ch: 13:39 撒稗子的仇敌就是魔鬼，收割的时候就是这世代的终结，收割的人就是天使。 ###EN### And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels.
Verse_Ch: 13:40 所以稗子怎样被薅集，且被火焚烧，在这世代的终结，也要如此。 ###EN### Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age.
Verse_Ch: 13:41 人子要差遣祂的使者，从祂的国里薅集一切绊跌人的事，和行不法的人， ###EN### The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will collect out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness,
Verse_Ch: 13:42 且要把他们丢到火炉里，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。 ###EN### And will cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Verse_Ch: 13:43 那时，义人在他们父的国里，要发光如同太阳。有耳可听的，就应当听。 ###EN### Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

Verse_Ch: 13:46 寻到一颗珍贵的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这珠子。 ###EN### And finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Verse_Ch: 13:47 还有，诸天的国好像网撒在海里，聚拢各样的水族。 ###EN### Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering from every species,
Verse_Ch: 13:48 网既满了，人就拉上岸来，坐下，把好的收到器皿里，坏的丢到外面去。 ###EN### Which, when it was filled, they brought onto the shore, and sat down and collected the good into vessels; but the foul they cast out.
Verse_Ch: 13:49 在这世代的终结，也要如此：天使要出来，把恶人从义人中间分别出来， ###EN### So it will be at the consummation of the age: the angels will go forth and separate the evil from the midst of the righteous,
Verse_Ch: 13:50 且要把他们丢到火炉里，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。 ###EN### And will cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Verse_Ch: 13:51 这一切的事，你们都领悟了么？他们对祂说，是的。 ###EN### Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes.
Verse_Ch: 13:52 祂又对他们说，因此，凡经学家作诸天之国门徒的，就像一个作家主的人，从他库里拿出新旧的东西来。 ###EN### And He said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.
Verse_Ch: 13:53 耶稣说完了这些比喻，就离开那里， ###EN### And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.
Verse_Ch: 13:54 来到自己的家乡，在他们的会堂里教训他们，以致他们都惊讶说，这人的智慧和异能，是从那里来的？ ###EN### And He came into His own country and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?
Verse_Ch: 13:55 这不是那木匠的儿子么？祂母亲不是叫马利亚么？祂兄弟们不是雅各、约西、西门和犹大么？ ###EN### Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Verse_Ch: 13:56 祂妹妹们不也都在我们这里么？祂这一切是从那里来的？ ###EN### And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?
Verse_Ch: 13:57 他们就因祂绊跌。但耶稣对他们说，申言者除了在本地本家之外，没有不被人尊敬的。 ###EN### And they were stumbled because of Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.
Verse_Ch: 13:58 因为他们不信，祂就不在那里多行异能了。 ###EN### And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief.
Chapter_Header: 14

Verse_Ch: 15:2 你的门徒为什么违犯古人的传统？因为他们吃饭的时候不洗手。 ###EN### Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
Verse_Ch: 15:3 祂就回答他们说，你们为什么因着你们的传统，违犯神的诫命？ ###EN### And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
Verse_Ch: 15:4 原来神说，“当孝敬父母，”又说，“咒骂父母的，要被处死。” ###EN### For God said, "Honor your father and your mother,'' and, "He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.''
Verse_Ch: 15:5 你们倒说，无论谁对父母说，我所当供养你的，已经作了礼物， ###EN### But you say, Whoever says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is now a gift to God,
Verse_Ch: 15:6 他就可以不孝敬父母。这就是你们因着你们的传统，使神的话失去效力和权柄。 ###EN### Shall by no means honor his father or his mother; and you have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition.
Verse_Ch: 15:7 假冒为善的人哪，以赛亚指着你们所申言的是对的；他说， ###EN### Hypocrites! Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you, saying,
Verse_Ch: 15:8 “这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我； " ###EN### This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;
Verse_Ch: 15:9 他们敬拜我也是徒然，因为他们将人的吩咐当作教训教导人。” ###EN### But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.''
Verse_Ch: 15:10 于是耶稣叫了群众来，对他们说，你们要听，也要领悟： ###EN### And He called the crowd to Him and said to them, Hear and understand:
Verse_Ch: 15:11 入口的不能污秽人，出口的乃能污秽人。 ###EN### It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.
Verse_Ch: 15:12 当时，门徒进前来，对祂说，法利赛人听见这话，被绊跌了，你知道么？ ###EN### Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?
Verse_Ch: 15:13 祂就回答说，凡不是我天父所栽种的植物，必要连根拔出来。 ###EN### And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.
Verse_Ch: 15:14 任凭他们吧，他们是瞎子的瞎眼领路者；若是瞎子领瞎子，两个都要掉在坑里。 ###EN### Let them be. They are blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Verse_Ch: 15:15 彼得就回答祂说，请给我们讲讲这比喻。 ###EN### And Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.
Verse_Ch: 15:16 祂就说，连你们到如今还不领悟么？ ###EN### And He said, Are you also still without understanding?
Verse_Ch: 15:17 岂不知凡入口的，是进到肚腹，又排泄到茅厕么？ ###EN### Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the drain?
Verse_Ch: 15:18 惟独出口的，是从心里发出来的，那才污秽人。 ###EN### But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man.
Verse_Ch: 15:19 因为从心里发出恶念、凶杀、奸淫、淫乱、偷窃、假见证和谤讟， ###EN### For out of the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.
Verse_Ch: 15:20 这些都是污秽人的；至于不洗手吃饭，却不污秽人。 ###EN### These are the things which defile the man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.
Verse_Ch: 15:21 耶稣离开那里，退到推罗、西顿的境内去。 ###EN### And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
Verse_Ch: 15:22 看哪，有一个迦南妇人从那地区出来，喊着说，主阿，大卫的子孙，可怜我！我女儿被鬼附得很苦。 ###EN### And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession.
Verse_Ch: 15:23 耶稣却一言不答。门徒就进前来，求祂说，请打发她走吧，因为她在我们后面直喊。 ###EN### But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us.
Verse_Ch: 15:24 耶稣回答说，我奉差遣，不过是到以色列家迷失的羊那里去。 ###EN### But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Verse_Ch: 15:25 那妇人来拜祂，说，主阿，帮助我！ ###EN### But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!
Verse_Ch: 15:26 祂回答说，不好拿儿女的饼丢给小狗。 ###EN### But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs.
Verse_Ch: 15:27 妇人说，主阿，是的，就是小狗也吃主人桌子上掉下来的碎渣。 ###EN### And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
Verse_Ch: 15:28 于是耶稣回答她说，妇人，你的信心真大！照你所愿的给你成全吧。从那时候，她的女儿就得了医治。 ###EN### Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
Verse_Ch: 15:29 耶稣遂离开那里，来到靠近加利利的海边，就上山，在那里坐下。 ###EN### And Jesus departed from there and came beside the Sea of Galilee; and He went up to the mountain and sat there.
Verse_Ch: 15:30 好多群众到祂跟前来，带着瘸子、瞎子、残废的、哑吧和好些别种病人，都放在祂的脚前，祂就治好了他们， ###EN### And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the dumb, and many other sick ones; and they laid them at His feet, and He healed them,
Verse_Ch: 15:31 以致群众都希奇，因看见哑吧说话，残废的痊愈，瘸子行走，瞎子看见；他们就荣耀以色列的神。 ###EN### So that the crowd marveled, because they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled healthy and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
Verse_Ch: 15:32 耶稣叫祂的门徒来，说，我对这群众动了慈心，因为他们同我在一起已经三天，也没有什么吃的了。我不愿意叫他们饿着散去，恐怕他们在路上困 乏。 ###EN### And Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.
Verse_Ch: 15:33 门徒就对祂说，我们在这旷野，那里有这么多的饼，叫这么多的群众吃饱？ ###EN### And the disciples said to Him, Where can we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?
Verse_Ch: 15:34 耶稣对他们说，你们有多少饼？他们说，七个，和几条小鱼。 ###EN### And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish.
Verse_Ch: 15:35 祂就吩咐群众坐在地上， ###EN### And after He commanded the crowd to recline on the ground,
Verse_Ch: 15:36 拿着这七个饼和几条鱼，祝谢了，擘开，递给门徒，门徒又递给群众。 ###EN### He took the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
Verse_Ch: 15:37 众人都吃，并且吃饱了。他们拾起剩下的零碎，装满了七筐子。 ###EN### And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.
Verse_Ch: 15:38 吃的人，除了妇女孩子，共有四千。 ###EN### And those who ate were four thousand men, apart from women and children.
Verse_Ch: 15:39 祂既解散了群众，就上船，来到马加丹的境界。 ###EN### And after He sent the crowds away, He stepped into the boat and came to the borders of Magadan.
Chapter_Header: 16
Verse_Ch: 16:1 法利赛人和撒都该人进前来，试诱耶稣，求祂从天上显个神迹给他们看。 ###EN### And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven.
Verse_Ch: 16:2 耶稣就回答他们说，黄昏到了，你们说，天要晴，因为天发红； ###EN### But He answered and said to them, When evening falls, you say, There will be fair weather, for the sky is red;
Verse_Ch: 16:3 在早晨，你们说，今天要有风雨，因为天发红，变阴暗。你们知道分辨天色，倒不能分辨这时期的神迹。 ###EN### And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and gloomy. The face of the sky you know how to discern, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
Verse_Ch: 16:4 邪恶淫乱的世代寻求神迹，除了约拿的神迹以外，再没有神迹给它。耶稣就撇开他们走了。 ###EN### An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah. And He left them and went away.
Verse_Ch: 16:5 门徒来到对岸，忘了带饼。 ###EN### And when the disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
Verse_Ch: 16:6 耶稣对他们说，你们要当心，提防法利赛人和撒都该人的酵。 ###EN### And Jesus said to them, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Verse_Ch: 16:7 门徒就彼此议论说，这是因为我们没有带饼吧。 ###EN### But they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we did not take bread.
Verse_Ch: 16:8 耶稣知道了，就说，小信的人哪，为什么因为没有饼就彼此议论？ ###EN### And Jesus, knowing it, said, Why are you reasoning among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have no bread?
Verse_Ch: 16:9 你们还不明白么？不记得那分给五千人的五个饼，和你们拾取了多少篮子？ ###EN### Do you not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many handbaskets you took up?
Verse_Ch: 16:10 也不记得那分给四千人的七个饼，和你们拾取了多少筐子？ ###EN### Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?
Verse_Ch: 16:11 你们怎么不明白？我对你们所说的，不是指着饼，乃是指着要提防法利赛人和撒都该人的酵。 ###EN### How is it that you do not understand that it was not about bread that I spoke to you? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Verse_Ch: 16:12 门徒这才领悟祂所说的，不是叫他们提防饼的酵，乃是叫他们提防法利赛人和撒都该人的教训。 ###EN### Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Verse_Ch: 16:13 耶稣到了该撒利亚腓立比的境内，就问祂的门徒说，人说人子是谁？ ###EN### Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?
Verse_Ch: 16:14 他们说，有人说是施浸者约翰，另有人说是以利亚，还有人说是耶利米，或申言者中的一位。 ###EN### And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
Verse_Ch: 16:15 祂对他们说，你们说我是谁？ ###EN### He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?
Verse_Ch: 16:16 西门彼得回答说，你是基督，是活神的儿子。 ###EN### And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Verse_Ch: 16:17 耶稣回答他说，西门巴约拿，你是有福的，因为不是血肉之人启示了你，乃是我在诸天之上的父启示了你。 ###EN### And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 16:18 我还告诉你，你是彼得，我要把我的召会建造在这磐石上，阴间的门不能胜过她。 ###EN### And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
Verse_Ch: 16:19 我要把诸天之国的钥匙给你，凡你在地上捆绑的，必是在诸天之上已经捆绑的；凡你在地上释放的，必是在诸天之上已经释放的。 ###EN### I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 16:20 于是耶稣嘱咐门徒，不可对人说祂是基督。 ###EN### Then He charged the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.
Verse_Ch: 16:21 从那时候，耶稣才指示祂的门徒，祂必须往耶路撒冷去，受长老、祭司长和经学家许多的苦，并且被杀，第三日复活。 ###EN### From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.
Verse_Ch: 16:22 彼得就拉祂到一边，责劝祂说，主阿，神眷怜你，这事绝不会临到你。 ###EN### And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!
Verse_Ch: 16:23 祂却转过来，对彼得说，撒但，退我后面去吧！你是绊跌我的，因为你不思念神的事，只思念人的事。 ###EN### But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
Verse_Ch: 16:24 于是耶稣对门徒说，若有人要跟从我，就当否认己，背起他的十字架，并跟从我。 ###EN### Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
Verse_Ch: 16:25 因为凡要救自己魂生命的，必丧失魂生命；凡为我丧失自己魂生命的，必得着魂生命。 ###EN### For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.
Verse_Ch: 16:26 人若赚得全世界，却赔上自己的魂生命，有什么益处？人还能拿什么换自己的魂生命？ ###EN### For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?
Verse_Ch: 16:27 因为人子要在祂父的荣耀里，同着众天使来临，那时祂要照各人的行为报应各人。 ###EN### For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings.
Verse_Ch: 16:28 我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人还没有尝到死味，必看见人子在祂的国里来临。 ###EN### Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
Chapter_Header: 17
Verse_Ch: 17:1 过了六天，耶稣带着彼得、雅各、和雅各的兄弟约翰，暗暗的领他们上了高山， ###EN### And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a high mountain privately.
Verse_Ch: 17:2 就在他们面前变了形像，脸面发光如日头，衣服变白如光。 ###EN### And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light.
Verse_Ch: 17:3 看哪，有摩西和以利亚向他们显现，同耶稣谈话。 ###EN### And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.
Verse_Ch: 17:4 彼得对耶稣说，主阿，我们在这里真好；你若愿意，我就在这里搭三座帐棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。 ###EN### And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
Verse_Ch: 17:5 他还说话的时候，看哪，有一朵光明的云彩遮盖他们；看哪，又有声音从云彩里出来，说，这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的，你们要听祂。 ###EN### While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!
Verse_Ch: 17:6 门徒听见，就面伏于地，极其害怕。 ###EN### And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their face and were greatly frightened.
Verse_Ch: 17:7 耶稣进前来，摸他们说，起来，不要害怕。 ###EN### And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid.
Verse_Ch: 17:8 他们举目不见一人，只见耶稣。 ###EN### And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.
Verse_Ch: 17:9 他们下山的时候，耶稣吩咐他们说，人子还没有从死人中复活，你们不要将所看见的告诉人。 ###EN### And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.
Verse_Ch: 17:10 门徒问祂说，那么，经学家为什么说，以利亚必须先来？ ###EN### And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Verse_Ch: 17:11 祂回答说，以利亚固然要来，并要复兴万事； ###EN### And He answered and said, Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things;
Verse_Ch: 17:12 只是我告诉你们，以利亚已经来了，人却不认识他，反而任意待他；照样，人子也要受他们的苦害。 ###EN### But I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.
Verse_Ch: 17:13 门徒这才领悟，祂是对他们说到施浸者约翰。 ###EN### Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.
Verse_Ch: 17:14 耶稣和门徒到了群众那里，有一个人到祂跟前来，向祂跪下说， ###EN### And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying,
Verse_Ch: 17:15 主阿，可怜我的儿子！因他患癫痫病很苦，屡次跌在火里，屡次跌在水里。 ###EN### Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.
Verse_Ch: 17:16 我带他到你门徒那里，他们却不能治好他。 ###EN### And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.
Verse_Ch: 17:17 耶稣回答说，唉，不信且悖谬的世代！我与你们同在要到几时？我忍耐你们要到几时？把他带到我这里来吧。 ###EN### And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.
Verse_Ch: 17:18 耶稣斥责那鬼，鬼就从他身上出来；从那时候，孩子就好了。 ###EN### And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour.
Verse_Ch: 17:19 那时，门徒暗暗的到耶稣跟前来，说，我们为什么不能赶出那鬼？ ###EN### Then the disciples, coming to Jesus privately, said, Why were we not able to cast it out?
Verse_Ch: 17:20 耶稣对他们说，因为你们的信心小；我实在告诉你们，你们若有信心像一粒芥菜种，就是对这座山说，从这边挪到那边，它也必挪去；并且在你们 就没有一件事是不可能的。 ###EN### And He said to them, Because of your little faith; for truly I say to you, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.
Verse_Ch: 17:21 至于这一类的鬼，若不祷告禁食，它就不出来。 ###EN### But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
Verse_Ch: 17:22 他们还聚集在加利利的时候，耶稣对他们说，人子将要被交在人手里， ###EN### And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,
Verse_Ch: 17:23 他们要杀害祂，第三日祂要复活。门徒就极其忧愁。 ###EN### And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised. And they were greatly grieved.
Verse_Ch: 17:24 他们到了迦百农，有收殿税的人前来对彼得说，你们的老师不纳殿税么？ ###EN### And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?
Verse_Ch: 17:25 彼得说，纳。等他进了屋子，耶稣先向他说，西门，你怎么看？地上的君王向谁征收关税或丁税？向自己的儿子，还是向外人？ ###EN### He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?
Verse_Ch: 17:26 彼得一说，向外人，耶稣就对他说，既然如此，儿子就可以免了。 ###EN### And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free.
Verse_Ch: 17:27 但为免绊跌他们，你要到海边去钓鱼，拿起先钓上来的鱼，开它的口，就必找到一块钱，可以拿去给他们，作你我的殿税。 ###EN### But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you.
Chapter_Header: 18
Verse_Ch: 18:1 当时，门徒到耶稣跟前来，说，谁在诸天的国里是最大的？ ###EN### In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?
Verse_Ch: 18:2 耶稣便叫一个小孩子来，站在他们中间，说， ###EN### And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst
Verse_Ch: 18:3 我实在告诉你们，你们若不回转，变成像小孩子一样，绝不能进诸天的国。 ###EN### And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 18:4 所以凡降卑自己像这小孩子的，这人在诸天的国里就是最大的。 ###EN### He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 18:5 凡因我的名，接待一个这样小孩子的，就是接待我。 ###EN### And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me;
Verse_Ch: 18:6 凡绊跌一个信入我的小子的，倒不如把大磨石挂在他的脖子上，沉没在深海里。 ###EN### And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.
Verse_Ch: 18:7 世界因着绊跌人的事有祸了；绊跌人的事是免不了的，但那绊跌人的有祸了。 ###EN### Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes.
Verse_Ch: 18:8 若是你的手或你的脚绊跌你，就把它砍下来扔掉；你残废或瘸腿进入生命，比有两手两脚被扔在永火里更好。 ###EN### If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.
Verse_Ch: 18:9 若是你的眼绊跌你，就把它剜出来扔掉；你只有一只眼进入生命，比有两只眼被扔在火坑里更好。 ###EN### And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire.
Verse_Ch: 18:10 你们要当心，不可轻看这小子里的一个。我告诉你们，他们的使者在诸天之上，常见我在诸天之上父的面。 ###EN### See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 18:11 因为人子来，是要拯救失丧的人。 ###EN### For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost.
Verse_Ch: 18:12 你们怎么看？一个人若有一百只羊，其中一只走迷了路，他岂不把这九十九只撇在山上，去找那迷路的么？ ###EN### What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray?
Verse_Ch: 18:13 若是找着了，我实在告诉你们，他为这一只欢喜，比为那没有迷路的九十九只欢喜还大。 ###EN### And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
Verse_Ch: 18:14 照样，你们在诸天之上的父，也不愿这小子里失丧一个。 ###EN### In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish.
Verse_Ch: 18:15 再者，若是你的弟兄犯罪得罪你，你要去，只在你和他之间指出他的过错。他若听你，你就得着了你的弟兄。 ###EN### Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.
Verse_Ch: 18:16 他若不听，你就另带一两个人同去，要凭两三个见证人的口，句句都可定准。 ###EN### But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
Verse_Ch: 18:17 他若不听他们，就告诉召会；他若连召会也不听，就把他当作外邦人和税吏。 ###EN### And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.
Verse_Ch: 18:18 我实在告诉你们，凡你们在地上捆绑的，必是在诸天之上已经捆绑的；凡你们在地上释放的，必是在诸天之上已经释放的。 ###EN### Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
Verse_Ch: 18:19 我又实在告诉你们，你们中间若有两个人在地上，在他们所求的任何事上和谐一致，他们无论求什么，都必从我在诸天之上的父，得着成全。 ###EN### Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.
Verse_Ch: 18:20 因为无论在那里，有两三个人被聚集到我的名里，那里就有我在他们中间。 ###EN### For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.
Verse_Ch: 18:21 那时，彼得进前来，对耶稣说，主阿，我的弟兄得罪我，我当赦免他几次？到七次么？ ###EN### Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?
Verse_Ch: 18:22 耶稣对他说，我不是对你说到七次，乃是到七十个七次。 ###EN### Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.
Verse_Ch: 18:23 因此，诸天的国好比一个作君王的人，要和他的奴仆算账。 ###EN### For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves.
Verse_Ch: 18:24 才算的时候，有人带了一个欠一万他连得银子的来。 ###EN### And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
Verse_Ch: 18:25 因为他没有什么可偿还的，主人吩咐把他和他的妻子儿女，并一切所有的都卖了来偿还。 ###EN### But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.

Verse_Ch: 23:36 我实在告诉你们，这一切的罪都要归到这世代了。 ###EN### Truly I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
Verse_Ch: 23:37 耶路撒冷阿，耶路撒冷阿，你常杀害申言者，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下， 只是你们不愿意。 ###EN### Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!

Verse_Ch: 25:39 又什么时候见你病了，或是在监里，来看你？ ###EN### And when have we seen You sick or in prison and have come to You?
Verse_Ch: 25:40 王要回答他们说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既作在我这些弟兄中最小的一个身上，就是作在我身上。 ###EN### And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to Me.
Verse_Ch: 25:41 然后祂又要对那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去。 ###EN### Then He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

Verse_Ch: 26:9 这香膏可以卖许多钱，分给穷人。 ###EN### For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor.
Verse_Ch: 26:10 耶稣知道了，就对他们说，为什么难为这女人？她在我身上作的，是一件美事。 ###EN### But Jesus, knowing it, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a noble deed to Me.
Verse_Ch: 26:11 因为常有穷人和你们同在，只是你们不常有我。 ###EN### For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me.
Verse_Ch: 26:12 她将这香膏浇在我身上，是为安葬我作的。 ###EN### For in pouring out this ointment on My body, she has done it for My burial.

Verse_Ch: 26:40 祂来到门徒那里，见他们睡着了，就对彼得说，怎么，你们不能同我儆醒片时么？ ###EN### And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?
Verse_Ch: 26:41 要儆醒祷告，免得入了试诱；你们的灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了。 ###EN### Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Verse_Ch: 26:42 祂第二次又去祷告说，我父阿，这杯若不能离开我，必要我喝，就愿你的旨意成就。 ###EN### Again, going away a second time, He prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.
Verse_Ch: 26:43 祂又来，见他们睡着了，因为他们的眼睛困倦。 ###EN### And coming again, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

Verse_Ch: 26:51 看哪，同耶稣在一起的人中，有一个伸手拔出刀来，将大祭司的奴仆砍了一刀，削掉了他一个耳朵。 ###EN### And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.
Verse_Ch: 26:52 于是耶稣对他说，把你的刀收回原处；因为凡动刀的，必死在刀下。 ###EN### Then Jesus said to him, Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.
Verse_Ch: 26:53 你想我不能求我父，现在为我派遣十二营多的天使来么？ ###EN### Or do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?
Verse_Ch: 26:54 若是这样，经上所说事情必须如此的话，怎能应验？ ###EN### How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must happen this way?
Verse_Ch: 26:55 当时，耶稣对群众说，你们带着刀棒出来捉我，如同捉强盗么？我天天坐在殿里施教，你们并没有捉拿我。 ###EN### In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest Me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me.
Verse_Ch: 26:56 但这一切成就了，为要应验申言者所写的。当下，门徒都离开祂逃走了。 ###EN### But all this has happened in order that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left Him and fled.

Verse_Ch: 26:59 祭司长和全议会尽力寻找假见证，控告耶稣，为要把祂治死， ###EN### Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put Him to death,
Verse_Ch: 26:60 总是得不到，尽管有好些假见证人上前作证。但后来有两个人上前说， ###EN### And they did not find it, though many false witnesses came forward. But later two came
Verse_Ch: 26:61 这个人曾说，我能拆毁神的殿，三日内又建造起来。 ###EN### And said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and build it up in three days.
Verse_Ch: 26:62 大祭司就站起来，对耶稣说，你什么都不回答么？这些人作见证告你的是什么？ ###EN### And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it that these testify against You?
Verse_Ch: 26:63 耶稣却默不作声。大祭司对祂说，我要你指着活神起誓告诉我们，你是神的儿子基督不是？ ###EN### But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him, I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.
Verse_Ch: 26:64 耶稣对他说，你说的对了。然而我还要告诉你们，从此以后你们要看见人子，坐在那大能者的右边，驾着天上的云而来。 ###EN### Jesus said to him, You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.

Verse_Ch: 26:67 于是他们吐唾沫在祂脸上，用拳头打祂，也有用手掌打祂的，说， ###EN### Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him,
Verse_Ch: 26:68 基督阿，对我们申言出，打你的是谁？ ###EN### Saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who hit You?
Verse_Ch: 26:69 彼得却在外面院子里坐着，有一个使女来到他跟前，说，你也是同那加利利人耶稣一起的。 ###EN### Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.
Verse_Ch: 26:70 彼得在众人面前却不承认，说，我不知道你说的是什么。 ###EN### But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about!

Verse_Ch: 27:23 总督说，为什么？祂作了什么恶事？他们却更加喊叫说，钉祂十字架！ ###EN### But he said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!
Verse_Ch: 27:24 彼拉多见无济于事，反要生乱，就拿水在群众面前洗手，说，流这人的血，罪不在我，你们自己看着办吧。 ###EN### And Pilate, seeing that nothing was gained but rather that an uproar was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man's blood. You see to it yourselves.

Verse_Ch: 27:40 你这拆毁圣殿，三日内建造起来的，救你自己吧！你若是神的儿子，就从十字架上下来吧！ ###EN### And saying, You who destroy the temple and build it up in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!
Verse_Ch: 27:41 祭司长，同经学家和长老，也是这样戏弄祂，说， ###EN### Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked Him and said,
Verse_Ch: 27:42 祂救了别人，不能救自己。祂是以色列的王，现在可以从十字架上下来，我们就信靠祂。 ###EN### He saved others; Himself He cannot save. He is King of Israel; let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on Him.
