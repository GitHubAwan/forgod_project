Verse_Ch: 15:34 你若回城去，对押沙龙说，王阿，我愿作你的仆人；我从前作你父亲的仆人，现在我也照样作你的仆人；这样，你就可以为我破坏亚希多弗的计谋。 ###EN### But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, I am your servant, O king; as I was your father's servant in the past, so will I be your servant now; then you will defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me.

Verse_Ch: 16:10 王说，洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们何干？他咒骂，若是因耶和华告诉他要咒骂大卫，如此，谁敢说你为什么这样行呢？ ###EN### But the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if Jehovah has told him to curse David, who then can say, Why have you done so?
Verse_Ch: 16:11 大卫又对亚比筛和众臣仆说，我亲生的儿子尚且寻索我的性命，何况这便雅悯人呢？由他咒骂罢，因为这是耶和华告诉他的。 ###EN### And David said to Abishai and all his servants, Now my son, who came forth from my body, seeks my life; how much more then this Benjaminite will do so. Leave him alone and let him curse, for Jehovah has told him to do so.
Verse_Ch: 16:12 或者耶和华见我遭难，为了今日这人对我的咒骂，就以好处回报我。 ###EN### It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done to me and that Jehovah will repay me with good for his cursing on this day.
Verse_Ch: 16:13 于是大卫和跟随他的人往前行路。示每沿着山边，与大卫并行，一面行走一面咒骂，又拿石头打他，拿尘土扬他。 ###EN### And David and his men went on their way. And Shimei went along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went; and he threw stones at him and cast dust upon him.

Verse_Ch: 16:19 再者，我当服事谁呢？岂不应当在前王的儿子面前服事么？我怎样在你父亲面前服事，也必照样在你面前服事。 ###EN### Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should it not be in the presence of his son? As I served in the presence of your father, so will I be in your presence.
Verse_Ch: 16:20 押沙龙对亚希多弗说，你们定个计谋，我们怎样行才好。 ###EN### Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your counsel as to what we should do.
Verse_Ch: 16:21 亚希多弗对押沙龙说，你父亲所留下看守宫殿的妃嫔，你可以与她们亲近。全以色列听见你已使你父亲憎恶你，凡与你在一起的人，手就更坚强了。 ###EN### And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in unto your father's concubines whom he left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself abhorrent to your father; then the hands of all those who are with you will be strong.
Verse_Ch: 16:22 于是人为押沙龙在宫殿的平顶上支搭帐棚；押沙龙在以色列众人眼前，与他父亲的妃嫔亲近。 ###EN### So they spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof, and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
Verse_Ch: 16:23 那些日子亚希多弗所定的计谋，好像人问神的话一样；他无论给大卫，或给押沙龙所定的计谋，都是这样。 ###EN### Now the counsel of Ahithophel that he gave in those days was as if one inquired of the oracle of God; all the counsel of Ahithophel was thus, both with David and with Absalom.

Verse_Ch: 17:1 亚希多弗又对押沙龙说，求你准我挑选一万二千人，今夜我就起身追赶大卫， ###EN### Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.
Verse_Ch: 17:2 趁他疲乏手软，我忽然追上他，使他惊惶；跟随他的民必都逃跑，我就单击杀王一人， ###EN### And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed. And I will terrorize him, and all the people who are with him will flee; then I will strike down the king only.
Verse_Ch: 17:3 使全民都归顺你。你所寻索的人一死，全民就如已经归顺你；全民就必平安无事。 ###EN### And I will bring all the people back to you; the return of the whole depends on what happens to the man whom you are seeking. All the people will be at peace.
Verse_Ch: 17:4 押沙龙和以色列的众长老都以这话为美。 ###EN### And the word seemed right in the sight of Absalom and in the sight of all the elders of Israel.
Verse_Ch: 17:5 押沙龙说，把亚基人户筛也召来，我们也要听他怎样说。 ###EN### Then Absalom said, Call now for Hushai the Archite also that we may hear what he also has to say.
Verse_Ch: 17:6 户筛到了押沙龙那里，押沙龙向他说，亚希多弗是如此如此说的，他所说的，我们可以去行么？若不可以，你就说罢。 ###EN### So Hushai came to Absalom; and Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken in this way. Shall we do what he says? If not, you speak.
Verse_Ch: 17:7 户筛对押沙龙说，亚希多弗这次所定的计谋不好。 ###EN### And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.
Verse_Ch: 17:8 户筛又说，你知道，你父亲和跟随他的人都是勇士，现在他们魂里苦恼，如同田野丢崽子的母熊一般，而且你父亲是个战士，必不和民一同住宿。 ###EN### Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men and bitter in soul, like a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and your father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people.
Verse_Ch: 17:9 他现今或藏在坑中，或在别处；若有人首先被杀，凡听见的必说，跟随押沙龙的民被杀了。 ###EN### He is now hidden in some pit or some other place; and when some of them fall at the beginning, whoever hears of it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who are with Absalom.
Verse_Ch: 17:10 即使是勇士，他的心像狮子的心，也必失去勇气；因为全以色列都知道你父亲是勇士，跟随他的也都是英勇的人。 ###EN### And even he who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt in fear; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and that those who are with him are valiant men.
Verse_Ch: 17:11 依我之计，不如将全以色列的人，从但直到别是巴，如同海边的沙那样多，聚集到你这里来，你也亲自出战。 ###EN### But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, like the sand that is by the sea in multitude, and that you go into battle in person.
Verse_Ch: 17:12 这样，我们在何处遇见他，就下到他那里，如同露水下在地上一般，连他带跟随他的众人，一个也不留下。 ###EN### Then we will come upon him in some place where he will be found, and we will light upon him as dew falls upon the ground; and we will not leave among him and among the men who are with him even one.
Verse_Ch: 17:13 他若进了那一座城，全以色列的人必带绳子去，将那城拉到河里，使那里连一块石头也找不到。 ###EN### And if he should withdraw into a city, all Israel will carry ropes to that city, and we will pull it into the river, until not even a stone is found there.
Verse_Ch: 17:14 押沙龙和以色列众人说，亚基人户筛的计谋比亚希多弗的计谋更好；这是因耶和华命定要破坏亚希多弗的良谋，为要使灾祸临到押沙龙。 ###EN### And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel; for Jehovah had ordained the defeat of the good counsel of Ahithophel to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.
Verse_Ch: 17:15 户筛对祭司撒督和亚比亚他说，亚希多弗为押沙龙和以色列的长老所定的计谋是如此如此，我所定的计谋是如此如此。 ###EN### Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus did I counsel.

Verse_Ch: 17:19 那家的妇人用大布铺在井面，又在上头铺上碎麦，事就没有给人知道。 ###EN### And his wife took the covering and spread it over the mouth of the well, and she strew grain over it; and the matter was unknown.
Verse_Ch: 17:20 押沙龙的仆人来到那家，到妇人那里，说，亚希玛斯和约拿单在那里？妇人对他们说，他们过了溪了。仆人找他们，找不着，就回耶路撒冷去了。 ###EN### Then Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?

And Jehovah said, It is because of Saul and because of his house of bloodshed, for he put those Gibeonites to death.
Verse_Ch: 21:2 原来这基遍人不是以色列人，乃是亚摩利人中所剩的；以色列人曾向他们起誓，不杀灭他们，扫罗却为以色列人和犹大人发热心，想要杀灭他们。大 卫王召了基遍人来， ###EN### So the king called for the Gibeonites and spoke to them.
