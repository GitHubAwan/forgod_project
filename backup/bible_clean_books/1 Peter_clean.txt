Verse_Ch: 2:21 你们蒙召原是为此，因基督也为你们受过苦，给你们留下榜样，叫你们跟随祂的脚踪行； ###EN### For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps;
Verse_Ch: 2:22 祂没有犯过罪，口里也找不到诡诈； ###EN### Who committed no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth;

Verse_Ch: 3:17 如果神的旨意要你们因行善受苦，总强如因行恶受苦。 ###EN### For it is better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
Verse_Ch: 3:18 因基督也曾一次为罪受死，就是义的代替不义的，为要引你们到神面前；在肉体里祂被治死，在灵里祂却活着； ###EN### For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit;
Verse_Ch: 3:19 在这灵里，祂也曾去向那些在监狱里的灵， ###EN### In which also He went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
Verse_Ch: 3:20 就是向从前在挪亚预备方舟的日子，神恒忍热切等待的时候，那些悖逆者宣扬；那进入方舟，借着水安全得救的不多，只有八个人。 ###EN### Who had formerly disobeyed when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; entering into which, a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water.
Verse_Ch: 3:21 这水所预表的浸，现在借着耶稣基督复活，也拯救你们；这浸并不是除掉肉体的污秽，乃是向神诉求无亏的良心。 ###EN### Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you, that is, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
Verse_Ch: 3:22 耶稣基督既已进入了天，就坐在神的右边，众天使和掌权的、并有能的，都服了祂。 ###EN### Who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him.
Chapter_Header: 4
Verse_Ch: 4:1 基督既在肉身受过苦，你们也当用同样的心思武装自己，（因为在肉身受过苦的，就与罪断绝了；） ###EN### Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind (because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin),
Verse_Ch: 4:2 好使你们不再从人的情欲，只从神的旨意，在肉身中度余下的光阴。 ###EN### No longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God.
Verse_Ch: 4:3 因为已过随从外邦人的心意，行邪荡、情欲、醉酒、荒宴、群饮、并不法可憎拜偶像的事，时候已经够了； ###EN### For the time which has passed is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having gone on in licentiousness, lusts, debaucheries, carousings, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.
Verse_Ch: 4:4 在这些事上，你们不与他们奔入同样放荡的洪流中，他们就以为怪，毁谤你们； ###EN### In this they think it strange that you are not running together with them into the same flood of dissoluteness, slandering you;
Verse_Ch: 4:5 他们必向那预备好要审判活人死人的主交账。 ###EN### Who will render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
Verse_Ch: 4:6 为此，就是现在死了的人，也曾有福音在他们活着的时候传给他们，好叫他们在肉身中照着人受审判，在灵里却照着神活着。 ###EN### For unto this end the gospel was announced also to those who are now dead, that they might be judged in the flesh according to men but live in the spirit according to God.
Verse_Ch: 4:7 但万物的结局已经临近了，所以要清明适度，并且要谨慎自守，以便祷告。 ###EN### But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore be sober-minded and be sober unto prayers.
Verse_Ch: 4:8 最要紧的，是彼此热切相爱，因为爱能遮盖众多的罪。 ###EN### Above all, have fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins.
Verse_Ch: 4:9 你们要互相款待，不发怨言； ###EN### Be hospitable to one another without murmuring,
Verse_Ch: 4:10 各人要照所得的恩赐，将这恩赐彼此供应，作神诸般恩典的好管家。 ###EN### Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.
Verse_Ch: 4:11 若有人讲论，要讲神的谕言；若有人服事，要按着神所供应的力量服事，叫神可以在凡事上借着耶稣基督得荣耀。愿荣耀权能归与祂，直到永永远远。 阿们。 ###EN### If anyone speaks, as speaking oracles of God; if anyone ministers, as ministering out of the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might forever and ever.

Verse_Ch: 4:16 但若因是基督徒受苦，却不要羞耻，倒要因着这名荣耀神。 ###EN### But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.
Verse_Ch: 4:17 因为时候到了，审判要从神的家起首。若是先从我们起首，那不信从神福音的人，将有何等的结局？ ###EN### For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?
Verse_Ch: 4:18 若是义人得救尚且如此艰难，那不敬虔和犯罪的人，将有何地可站？ ###EN### And if the righteous man is saved only with difficulty, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?
Verse_Ch: 4:19 所以那照神旨意受苦的人，也要在善行上，将他们的魂交与那信实的创造主。 ###EN### So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.
