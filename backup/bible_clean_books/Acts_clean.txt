Verse_Ch: 23:1 保罗定睛看着议会，说，诸位，弟兄们，我在神面前行事为人都是凭着无亏的良心，直到今日。 ###EN### And Paul, looking intently at the Sanhedrin, said, Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day.
Verse_Ch: 23:2 大祭司亚拿尼亚就吩咐旁边站着的人打他的嘴。 ###EN### And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
Verse_Ch: 23:3 保罗对他说，你这粉饰的墙，神将要击打你了。你坐堂是要按律法审问我，你竟违背律法，吩咐人打我么？ ###EN### Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. And do you sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck?
Verse_Ch: 23:4 站在旁边的人说，你辱骂神的大祭司么？ ###EN### And those standing by said, Do you revile the high priest of God?
Verse_Ch: 23:5 保罗说，弟兄们，我不晓得他是大祭司；经上记着，“不可毁谤你百姓的官长。” ###EN### And Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, "You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people.''
Verse_Ch: 23:6 保罗看出其中一部分是撒都该人，另一部分是法利赛人，就在议会中喊着说，诸位，弟兄们，我是法利赛人，是法利赛人的子孙；我现在受审问，是 为了盼望死人复活。 ###EN### And Paul, knowing that one part was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the Sanhedrin, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!
Verse_Ch: 23:7 他说了这话，法利赛人和撒都该人便起了争执，会众就分裂了。 ###EN### And when he spoke this, a dissension took place between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.
Verse_Ch: 23:8 因为撒都该人说没有复活，也没有天使和灵；法利赛人却样样都承认。 ###EN### For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
Verse_Ch: 23:9 于是大大的喧嚷起来，有几个法利赛派的经学家站起来争辩说，我们在这人身上看不出什么恶来，说不定有灵或天使对他说过话。 ###EN### And there was a great outcry; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party rose up and contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man. And what if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?
Verse_Ch: 23:10 那时大起纷争，千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了，就吩咐兵丁下去，把他从众人当中抢出来，带进营楼去。 ###EN### And when much dissension had taken place, the commander, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the detachment of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst and bring him into the barracks.
Verse_Ch: 23:11 当夜，主站在保罗旁边说，你当壮胆，你怎样在耶路撒冷郑重的为我作了见证，也必照样在罗马为我作见证。 ###EN### But in the night following, the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified to the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome.
Verse_Ch: 23:12 到了天亮，犹太人就团结同谋，发咒起誓说，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝。 ###EN### And when it became day, the Jews formed a plot and put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
Verse_Ch: 23:13 一同起誓订这阴谋的，有四十多人。 ###EN### And there were more than forty who swore to this conspiracy.
Verse_Ch: 23:14 他们来到祭司长和长老跟前，说，我们已经厉害的发咒起誓，若不先杀保罗，就不吃什么。 ###EN### They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, We have bound ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.
Verse_Ch: 23:15 现在你们连同议会要通知千夫长，叫他带保罗下到你们这里来，假作要更详确审断他的事；我们已经预备好了，不等他走近，就杀掉他。 ###EN### Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him; and we, before he draws near, are ready to do away with him.
Verse_Ch: 23:16 保罗的外甥听见这埋伏的事，就来，进了营楼，告诉保罗。 ###EN### But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered into the barracks and reported it to Paul.
Verse_Ch: 23:17 保罗请一个百夫长来，说，你带这青年人到千夫长那里，他有事要告诉他。 ###EN### And Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Bring this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.
Verse_Ch: 23:18 于是百夫长拉着他，带到千夫长那里，说，被囚的保罗请我到他那里，求我带这青年人到你这里，他有事要告诉你。 ###EN### So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, The prisoner Paul called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you.
Verse_Ch: 23:19 千夫长就拉着他的手走到一旁，私下查问说，你有什么事要告诉我？ ###EN### And the commander took him by the hand and, withdrawing privately, inquired, What is it that you have to report to me?
Verse_Ch: 23:20 他说，犹太人已经约定，要求你明天带保罗下到议会里去，假作要更详确查问他的事。 ###EN### And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.
Verse_Ch: 23:21 你不要听从他们，因为他们中间有四十多人，埋伏着等待保罗，并且已经发咒起誓，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝；现在他们预备好了，只等你应允。 ###EN### So you should not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him; they have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him. And now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you.
Verse_Ch: 23:22 于是千夫长打发那青年人走，嘱咐他说，不要对任何人泄漏，说你将这事通知我了。 ###EN### So the commander dismissed the young man, charging him, Do not tell anyone that you have informed me of these things.
Verse_Ch: 23:23 千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来，说，预备步兵二百、马兵七十、长枪手二百，今夜九时往该撒利亚去。 ###EN### And he called to him a certain two of the centurions and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, as well as seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night;
Verse_Ch: 23:24 也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上，把他平安的护送到总督腓力斯那里去。 ###EN### And they were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
Verse_Ch: 23:25 千夫长又写了文书， ###EN### And he wrote a letter having this form:
Verse_Ch: 23:26 大意如下：革老丢吕西亚请总督腓力斯大人安。 ###EN### Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency, Governor Felix, rejoice.
Verse_Ch: 23:27 这人被犹太人拿住，将要遭害，我得知他是罗马人，就带兵丁到场，把他救出来。 ###EN### This man, having been seized by the Jews and about to be done away with by them, I came upon with my detachment of soldiers and rescued, when I learned that he was a Roman.
Verse_Ch: 23:28 因为想要确知他们告他的缘故，我就带他下到他们的议会去， ###EN### And intending to ascertain the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin,
Verse_Ch: 23:29 便查知他被告，是因他们律法的问题，并没有什么该死该绑的罪名。 ###EN### And found him to be accused concerning questions of their law, but having nothing worthy of death or of bonds laid to his charge.
Verse_Ch: 23:30 后来有人把要害这人的阴谋告诉我，我就立刻解他到你那里去，又吩咐告他的人，到你面前告他。 ###EN### And when it was disclosed to me that there was a plot against the man, I sent him at once to you, charging the accusers also to speak the things against him before you.
Verse_Ch: 23:31 于是兵丁照所指示他们的，夜里将保罗带到安提帕底。 ###EN### So the soldiers, according to what they had been directed, took up Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Verse_Ch: 23:32 第二天让马兵同保罗前行，他们就回营楼去了。 ###EN### And on the next day, leaving the horsemen to depart with him, they returned to the barracks.
Verse_Ch: 23:33 马兵来到该撒利亚，把文书呈给总督，也把保罗带到他面前。 ###EN### And when they entered into Caesarea and handed over the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also to him.
Verse_Ch: 23:34 总督念了，就问保罗是那省的人；既查知他是基利家人， ###EN### And when he had read it, he asked from what province he was; and learning that he was from Cilicia,
Verse_Ch: 23:35 就说，等告你的人来到，我要细听你的事。便吩咐人把他看守在希律的王府里。 ###EN### He said, I will hear your case fully when your accusers also arrive. And he ordered him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium.
Chapter_Header: 24
Verse_Ch: 24:1 过了五天，大祭司亚拿尼亚同几个长老，和一个辩士帖土罗下来，向总督控告保罗。 ###EN### And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a certain orator, Tertullus; and they gave their information against Paul to the governor.
Verse_Ch: 24:2 保罗被传了来，帖土罗就控告说， ###EN### And when Paul was called, Tertullus began to accuse him saying, Since we have obtained much peace through you, and since reforms are being carried out for this nation through your forethought
Verse_Ch: 24:3 腓力斯大人，我们因你得以大享太平，并且这国因你的先见，随事随处得了改革，我们满心感谢的领受。 ###EN### Both in every way and everywhere, we welcome it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
Verse_Ch: 24:4 但为了不多耽误你，只求你宽容，略听我们几句。 ###EN### But that I may not detain you further, I entreat you to hear us briefly in your forbearance.
Verse_Ch: 24:5 我们看这个人是瘟疫，是鼓动普天下众犹太人生乱的，又是拿撒勒派里的一个头目， ###EN### For we have found this man a pest and an agitator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,
Verse_Ch: 24:6 连圣殿他也试图要污秽，我们把他捉住了，要按我们的律法审问。 ###EN### Who has also tried to profane the temple. Him also we laid hold of and wanted to judge according to our law,
Verse_Ch: 24:7 不料，千夫长吕西亚前来，甚是强横，从我们手中把他夺去， ###EN### But Lysias the commander came by and with much force took him away from our hands
Verse_Ch: 24:8 吩咐告他的人到你这里来。你自己查问他，就可以确知我们告他的一切事了。 ###EN### And ordered his accusers to come to you. When you have examined this man yourself concerning all these things, you will be able to ascertain from him the things which we accuse him of.
Verse_Ch: 24:9 众犹太人也都附和，证实事情确是这样。 ###EN### And the Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.
Verse_Ch: 24:10 总督点头叫保罗说话，他就回答说，我知道你在这国里审案多年，所以我乐意为自己的事分诉。 ###EN### And when the governor nodded for him to speak, Paul answered: Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I gladly make my defense for the things concerning myself,
Verse_Ch: 24:11 你能确知，从我上耶路撒冷敬拜，到今日不过有十二天。 ###EN### Since you can realize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
Verse_Ch: 24:12 他们并没有看见我在殿里，或是在会堂里，或是在城里，同什么人辩论，或耸动群众， ###EN### And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with anyone nor stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.
Verse_Ch: 24:13 就是他们现在所告我的事，也不能向你证实。 ###EN### Neither are they able to prove to you the things which they now accuse me of.
Verse_Ch: 24:14 但有一件事我要向你承认，就是我正按着他们所称为异端的道路，事奉我们祖宗的神，又信合乎律法的，和申言者书上一切所记载的； ###EN### But I confess this to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all the things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets;
Verse_Ch: 24:15 我向神存着盼望，无论义的和不义的都要复活，就是他们自己也是这样盼望。 ###EN### Having hope toward God, which these themselves also look for, that there is to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.
Verse_Ch: 24:16 我因此操练自己，对神对人常存无亏的良心。 ###EN### Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men.
Verse_Ch: 24:17 过了几年，我上去周济我本国的百姓，并献供物， ###EN### Now after many years I came bringing alms to my nation and offerings;
Verse_Ch: 24:18 正献的时候，他们看见我在殿里已经洁净了，并没有聚众，也没有生乱，不过只有几个从亚西亚来的犹太人， ###EN### In which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd or uproar. But certain Jews from Asia,
Verse_Ch: 24:19 他们若有告我的事，就应当到你面前来告我。 ###EN### Who should have been present before you and made accusation if they had anything against me --
Verse_Ch: 24:20 即或不然，当我站在议会前，这些人若看出我有不对的地方，他们自己也可以说出来。 ###EN### Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin,
Verse_Ch: 24:21 纵然有，也不过是为了我站在他们中间所喊的这一声：我今日在你们面前受审，是为死人复活。 ###EN### Other than concerning this one sound which I cried out while standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged today before you.
Verse_Ch: 24:22 腓力斯既更加详确的晓得关于这道路的事，就拖延他们，说，且等千夫长吕西亚下来，我要审断你们的事。 ###EN### But Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will determine your affairs.
Verse_Ch: 24:23 于是吩咐百夫长看守保罗，并且宽待他，也不拦阻他自己的人来供给他。 ###EN### And he directed the centurion to keep him in custody, and that he should have some liberty and that no one should prevent his own people from attending to him.
Verse_Ch: 24:24 过了几天，腓力斯和他夫人犹太的女子土西拉一同来到，就传见保罗，并听他讲论信入基督耶稣的事。 ###EN### But after some days, Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
Verse_Ch: 24:25 保罗讲论公义、节制、和将来的审判，腓力斯感到惧怕，就说，你暂且去吧，等我得便再叫你来。 ###EN### And as he was reasoning concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will call for you;
Verse_Ch: 24:26 同时腓力斯又指望保罗送钱给他，所以屡次打发人叫他来，和他谈论。 ###EN### Hoping at the same time also that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore he also sent for him more frequently and conversed with him.
Verse_Ch: 24:27 过了两年，波求非斯都接了腓力斯的任；腓力斯要讨好犹太人，就留保罗在捆锁中。 ###EN### And when two years were completed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and wanting to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.
Chapter_Header: 25
Verse_Ch: 25:1 非斯都到省上任，过了三天，就从该撒利亚上耶路撒冷去。 ###EN### Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
Verse_Ch: 25:2 祭司长和犹太人的首领，向他控告保罗， ###EN### And the chief priests and leading men of the Jews gave their information to him against Paul; and they entreated him,
Verse_Ch: 25:3 不断恳求非斯都，向他求情对付保罗，将他提到耶路撒冷来，他们要在路上埋伏杀害他。 ###EN### Asking for a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, they themselves setting an ambush to do away with him on the way.
Verse_Ch: 25:4 非斯都就回答说，保罗押在该撒利亚，我不久就要亲自往那里去。 ###EN### Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed there shortly.
Verse_Ch: 25:5 又说，你们中间有权势的人与我一同下去，那人若有什么不是，就可以告他。 ###EN### Therefore, he said, let influential men from among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.
Verse_Ch: 25:6 非斯都在他们中间，住了不过十天八天，就下该撒利亚去，第二天坐在审判台上，吩咐将保罗提上来。 ###EN### And having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought.
Verse_Ch: 25:7 保罗来了，那些从耶路撒冷下来的犹太人，围绕他站着，提出许多严重的事控告他，都是他们不能证实的。 ###EN### And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they were not able to prove,
Verse_Ch: 25:8 保罗分诉说，无论犹太人的律法，或是圣殿，或是该撒，我都没有得罪过。 ###EN### While Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned in anything.
Verse_Ch: 25:9 但非斯都要讨好犹太人，就回答保罗说，关于这些事，你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里在我面前受审么？ ###EN### But Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things?
Verse_Ch: 25:10 保罗说，我是站在该撒的审判台前，这是我应当受审的地方；我向犹太人并没有行过什么不对的事，这也是你明明知道的。 ###EN### And Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.
Verse_Ch: 25:11 我若行了不对的事，犯了什么该死的罪，就是死，我也不辞；但他们所告我的事，若都是虚的，就没有人可以把我交给他们。我上诉于该撒。 ###EN### If therefore I am doing wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing to the things which these accuse me of, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.
Verse_Ch: 25:12 非斯都和议会商量了，就回答说，你既上诉于该撒，就要往该撒那里去。 ###EN### Then when Festus had conferred with the council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.
Verse_Ch: 25:13 过了些日子，亚基帕王和百尼基氏来到该撒利亚，问候非斯都。 ###EN### Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.
Verse_Ch: 25:14 他们在那里住了多日，非斯都将保罗的事向王陈述说，这里有一个人，是腓力斯留下来的囚犯。 ###EN### And while they were staying some additional days there, Festus laid before the king the matters regarding Paul, saying, There is a certain man who has been left a prisoner by Felix,
Verse_Ch: 25:15 我在耶路撒冷的时候，祭司长和犹太人的长老，将他的事禀报了我，求我定他的罪。 ###EN### Concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information and asked for a sentence against him.
Verse_Ch: 25:16 我回答他们说，无论什么人，被告还没有和原告当面对质，未得机会分诉所告他的事，就先把他交给对方，这不是罗马人的规例。 ###EN### To them I answered that it is not the custom with Romans to hand over any man before he who is accused meets the accusers face to face and has an opportunity for a defense concerning the charge.
Verse_Ch: 25:17 及至他们都来到这里，我就不耽延，第二天便坐在审判台上，吩咐把那人提上来。 ###EN### So when they had come together here, I made no delay; on the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought.
Verse_Ch: 25:18 原告站着告他，所告的并没有我所意料的恶事； ###EN### Concerning him the accusers stood and brought no charge of the evil things I was suspecting.
Verse_Ch: 25:19 不过是和保罗争论一些他们自己敬鬼神的问题，又关于一位已经死了的耶稣，保罗断言祂是活着的。 ###EN### But they had certain questions against him concerning their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Verse_Ch: 25:20 关于这些争论，我心里作难，就问他愿不愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里为这些事受审。 ###EN### And being at a loss as to how there should be an inquiry concerning these things, I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these things.
Verse_Ch: 25:21 但保罗诉求把他留下，等待皇上审断，我就吩咐把他留下，等我解他到该撒那里去。 ###EN### But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I should send him up to Caesar.
Verse_Ch: 25:22 亚基帕对非斯都说，我也愿意亲自听听这个人。非斯都说，明天你可以听他。 ###EN### And Agrippa said to Festus, I myself also would like to hear the man. Tomorrow, said Festus, you shall hear him.
Verse_Ch: 25:23 第二天，亚基帕和百尼基大张威势而来，同着众千夫长和城里杰出的人，进了厅堂；非斯都吩咐一声，就有人将保罗提上来。 ###EN### Therefore on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered into the hall of audience together with the commanders and prominent men of the city, and when Festus had given the order, Paul was brought.
Verse_Ch: 25:24 非斯都说，亚基帕王和同我们在座的诸位，你们看这人，为了他，耶路撒冷和这里全群的犹太人曾向我恳求，嚷着说，这个人不该再活着。 ###EN### And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you men who are present with us, you behold this man, concerning whom all the multitude of Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
Verse_Ch: 25:25 但我查明他没有犯什么该死的罪，并且他自己既然要上诉于皇上，我就定意把他解去。 ###EN### But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
Verse_Ch: 25:26 论到这人，我没有确实的事可以呈奏主上；因此我带他到你们面前，也特意带他到你亚基帕王面前，为要在审问之后，有所陈奏。 ###EN### Concerning him I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that when the examination has taken place, I may have something to write.
Verse_Ch: 25:27 据我看来，解送囚犯，不指明他的罪状，是不合理的。 ###EN### For it seems unreasonable to me, in sending a prisoner, not to also signify the charges against him.
Chapter_Header: 26
Verse_Ch: 26:1 亚基帕对保罗说，准你为自己申诉。于是保罗伸手分诉说， ###EN### And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
Verse_Ch: 26:2 亚基帕王阿，犹太人控告我的一切事，今日得在你面前分诉，乃为有幸； ###EN### Concerning all the things which I am accused of by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself blessed that I am to make my defense before you today,
Verse_Ch: 26:3 尤其你熟悉犹太人的一切规例，和他们的问题，所以求你耐心听我。 ###EN### Especially since you are familiar with all the customs and questions among the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
Verse_Ch: 26:4 我从起初在本国的民中，并在耶路撒冷，自幼为人如何，犹太人都知道。 ###EN### The manner of my life from youth, which from the beginning was among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all the Jews know,
Verse_Ch: 26:5 他们若肯作见证，他们从起初早就晓得，我是按着我们宗教最严紧的教派，作了法利赛人。 ###EN### Since they have previously known about me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.
Verse_Ch: 26:6 现在我站着受审，是因为盼望神向我们祖宗所应许的； ###EN### And now I stand here being judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,
Verse_Ch: 26:7 这应许，我们十二个支派昼夜切切的事奉神，都盼望得着；王阿，我被犹太人控告，就是因这盼望。 ###EN### To which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king.
Verse_Ch: 26:8 神既叫死人复活，你们为什么断为不可信的？ ###EN### Why is it judged incredible among you if God raises the dead?
Verse_Ch: 26:9 从前我自己也以为，应当多方攻击拿撒勒人耶稣的名。 ###EN### Well then, I thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,
Verse_Ch: 26:10 我在耶路撒冷就曾这样行了；既从祭司长得了权柄，我就把许多圣徒囚在监里，并且他们被杀，我也投票定罪。 ###EN### Which also I did in Jerusalem; and I both shut up many of the saints in prison when I had received authority from the chief priests and cast a vote against them when they were being done away with.
Verse_Ch: 26:11 在各会堂，我屡次用刑，想强逼他们说亵渎的话，又格外恼恨他们，甚至追逼他们，直到外邦的城邑。 ###EN### And in all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to compel them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged at them, I persecuted them even as far as foreign cities.
Verse_Ch: 26:12 那时，我领了祭司长的权柄和使命，往大马色去。 ###EN### Engaged in these things, I journeyed to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests.
Verse_Ch: 26:13 王阿，正午的时候，我在路上看见一道光，比日头还亮，从天上四面照着我和与我同行的人。 ###EN### At midday, on the way, I saw, O king, a light from heaven beyond the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.
Verse_Ch: 26:14 我们都仆倒在地上，我就听见有声音，用希伯来语向我说，扫罗，扫罗，你为什么逼迫我？你踢犁棒是难的。 ###EN### And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
Verse_Ch: 26:15 我说，主阿，你是谁？主说，我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。 ###EN### And I said, Who are You, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
Verse_Ch: 26:16 你起来站着，我向你显现，正是要选定你作执事和见证人，将你所看见我的事，和我将要显现给你的事，见证出来； ###EN### But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you;
Verse_Ch: 26:17 我要拯救你脱离百姓和外邦人。 ###EN### Delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,
Verse_Ch: 26:18 我差你到他们那里去，叫他们的眼睛得开，从黑暗转入光中，从撒但权下转向神，又因信入我，得蒙赦罪，并在一切圣别的人中得着基业。 ###EN### To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.

Verse_Ch: 27:9 过了相当的时候，禁食的节期也过去了，行船又危险，保罗就劝众人说， ###EN### And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, and also because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,
Verse_Ch: 27:10 诸位，我看这次航行，不但货物和船只要受到伤害，大遭损失，就连我们的性命也难保。 ###EN### Saying to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage is to be with damage and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.
Verse_Ch: 27:11 但百夫长宁愿信从船长和船主，却不信从保罗所说的。 ###EN### But the centurion was persuaded by the navigator and the ship's owner rather than by the things that were being said by Paul.
Verse_Ch: 27:12 且因这港口不适于过冬，大多数的人就主张从那里开船，或者能到非尼喀过冬。非尼喀是革哩底的一个港口，一面朝东北，一面朝东南。 ###EN### And as the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority gave counsel to put out to sea from there, if somehow they might be able to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing northeast and southeast, and spend the winter there.

Verse_Ch: 27:19 到第三天，他们又亲手把船上的用具抛弃了。 ###EN### And on the third day they threw the ship's gear overboard, even with their own hands.
Verse_Ch: 27:20 太阳和星辰多日不显露，又有狂风大浪催逼，我们得救的指望就都绝了。 ###EN### And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and while no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope that we might be saved was being abandoned.

Verse_Ch: 27:23 因我所属所事奉的神，祂的使者昨夜站在我旁边，说， ###EN### For this very night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me,
Verse_Ch: 27:24 保罗，不要害怕，你必站在该撒面前，看哪，与你同船的人，神都赐给你了。 ###EN### Saying, Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.
Verse_Ch: 27:25 所以诸位，要放心振作，我信神怎样对我说，事情也要怎样成就。 ###EN### Therefore, cheer up, men, for I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me.
Verse_Ch: 27:26 只是我们必撞在一个岛上。 ###EN### But we must run aground on a certain island.
Verse_Ch: 27:27 到了第十四天夜里，我们在亚底亚海飘来飘去，约到半夜，水手以为渐近旱地， ###EN### But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors suspected that some land was approaching them.

Verse_Ch: 27:29 恐怕撞在石头上，就从船尾抛下四个锚，期待着天亮。 ###EN### And fearing that we might run aground somewhere on rocky places, they threw four anchors from the stern and wished for day to come.
Verse_Ch: 27:30 水手想要离船逃走，就把小艇放在海里，假作要从船头抛锚的样子。 ###EN### And when the sailors sought to flee from the ship, having lowered the small boat into the sea under pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,
Verse_Ch: 27:31 保罗对百夫长和兵丁说，这些人若不留在船上，你们必不能得救。 ###EN### Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.
Verse_Ch: 27:32 于是兵丁砍断小艇的绳子，任它飘去。 ###EN### Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the small boat and let it fall away.
Verse_Ch: 27:33 从那时到天快亮，保罗一直劝众人用饭，说，你们悬望忍饿不吃什么，今天已是第十四天了。 ###EN### And until day was about to come, Paul encouraged them all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued watching without food, taking nothing.
Verse_Ch: 27:34 所以我劝你们用饭，这与你们的得救有关，因为你们各人连一根头发也不至于损坏。 ###EN### Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your salvation; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish.
Verse_Ch: 27:35 保罗说了这话，就拿着饼，在众人面前感谢了神，然后擘开来吃。 ###EN### And when he had said these things and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all; and he broke it and began to eat.
Verse_Ch: 27:36 于是众人都放心振作，也就用饭了。 ###EN### And all became cheerful, and they also took food.
Verse_Ch: 27:37 我们在船上的，共有二百七十六个人。 ###EN### Now we were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship.
Verse_Ch: 27:38 他们吃饱了，就把麦子抛在海里，叫船轻一点。 ###EN### And when they were satisfied with food, they began to lighten the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
Verse_Ch: 27:39 到了天亮，他们不认识那地方，只看见一个有岸可登的海湾，就商议能把船拢进去不能。 ###EN### And when day came, they could not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay, which had a beach, into which they took counsel to drive the ship, if they were able.
Verse_Ch: 27:40 于是把锚丢弃在海里，同时松开舵绳，拉起前帆，顺着风向岸驶去。 ###EN### And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the bands of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the blowing of the wind, they held course for the beach.
Verse_Ch: 27:41 但遇着两水夹流的地方，就把船搁了浅；船头胶着不动，船尾被浪猛力冲坏了。 ###EN### But striking a sandbar with the sea on both sides, they ran the vessel aground; and the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was broken up by the violence of the waves.
Verse_Ch: 27:42 兵丁的意思是要把囚犯杀了，恐怕有人泅水逃走； ###EN### And the counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest anyone swim away and escape;
Verse_Ch: 27:43 但百夫长愿意叫保罗安全得救，不准他们任意而行，就吩咐会泅水的，跳下水去先上岸； ###EN### But the centurion, intending to bring Paul safely through, prevented them from their intention and ordered those who were able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to the land,
Verse_Ch: 27:44 其余的人，有的可以用木板，有的可以用船上的东西上岸。这样，众人都安全得救上了岸。 ###EN### And the rest to follow, some on planks, and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were brought safely through onto the land.

Verse_Ch: 28:3 那时，保罗拾起一捆柴放在火上，有一条毒蛇因热出来，缠住他的手。 ###EN### But when Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened onto his hand.
Verse_Ch: 28:4 土人看见那毒蛇悬在他手上，就彼此说，这人必是个凶手，虽然从海里安全得救，公理还不容他活着。 ###EN### And when the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, whom, though he has been brought safely out of the sea, Justice has not allowed to live.
Verse_Ch: 28:5 保罗竟把那毒蛇甩在火里，并没有受伤。 ###EN### However he shook off the snake into the fire and suffered no harm;

Verse_Ch: 28:8 当时，部百流的父亲患热病和痢疾躺着，保罗进到他那里，祷告并按手在他身上，医好了他。 ###EN### And the father of Publius was lying down sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him, and having prayed and laid his hands on him, healed him.
